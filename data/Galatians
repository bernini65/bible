Certainly not! </span><span class=\"v48_2_18\"><sup id=\"Gal.2.18\" class=\"v48_2_18\">18</sup>For if I rebuild what I tore down, I prove myself to be a transgressor. </span><span class=\"v48_2_19\"><sup id=\"Gal.2.19\" class=\"v48_2_19\">19</sup>For through the law I died to the law, so that I might live to God. </span><span class=\"v48_2_20\"><sup id=\"Gal.2.20\" class=\"v48_2_20\">20</sup>I have been crucified with Christ.

Who hindered you from obeying the truth? </span><span class=\"v48_5_8\"><sup id=\"Gal.5.8\" class=\"v48_5_8\">8</sup>This persuasion is not from him who calls you. </span><span class=\"v48_5_9\"><sup id=\"Gal.5.9\" class=\"v48_5_9\">9</sup>A little leaven leavens the whole lump. </span><span class=\"v48_5_10\"><sup id=\"Gal.5.10\" class=\"v48_5_10\">10</sup>I have confidence in the Lord that you will take no other view, and the one who is troubling you will bear the penalty, whoever he is. </span><span class=\"v48_5_11\"><sup id=\"Gal.5.11\" class=\"v48_5_11\">11</sup>But if I, brothers, still preach circumcision, why am I still being persecuted? In that case the offense of the cross has been removed. </span><span class=\"v48_5_12\"><sup id=\"Gal.5.12\" class=\"v48_5_12\">12</sup>I wish those who unsettle you would emasculate themselves!</span></p>\n<p class=\"p\"><span class=\"v48_5_13\"><sup id=\"Gal.5.13\" class=\"v48_5_13\">13</sup>For you were called to freedom, brothers. Only do not use your freedom as an opportunity for the flesh, but through love serve one another. </span><span class=\"v48_5_14\"><sup id=\"Gal.5.14\" class=\"v48_5_14\">14</sup>For the whole law is fulfilled in one word: \u201cYou shall love your neighbor as yourself.\u201d </span><span class=\"v48_5_15\"><sup id=\"Gal.5.15\" class=\"v48_5_15\">15</sup>But if you bite and devour one another, watch out that you are not consumed by one another.</span></p>\n<h3 class=\"s1\">Keep in Step with the Spirit</h3>\n<p class=\"p\"><span class=\"v48_5_16\"><sup id=\"Gal.5.16\" class=\"v48_5_16\">16</sup>But I say, walk by the Spirit, and you will not gratify the desires of the flesh. </span><span class=\"v48_5_17\"><sup id=\"Gal.5.17\" class=\"v48_5_17\">17</sup>For the desires of the flesh are against the Spirit, and the desires of the Spirit are against the flesh, for these are opposed to each other, to keep you from doing the things you want to do. </span><span class=\"v48_5_18\"><sup id=\"Gal.5.18\" class=\"v48_5_18\">18</sup>But if you are led by the Spirit, you are not under the law. </span><span class=\"v48_5_19\"><sup id=\"Gal.5.19\" class=\"v48_5_19\">19</sup>Now the works of the flesh are evident: sexual immorality, impurity, sensuality, </span><span class=\"v48_5_20\"><sup id=\"Gal.5.20\" class=\"v48_5_20\">20</sup>idolatry, sorcery, enmity, strife, jealousy, fits of anger, rivalries, dissensions, divisions, </span><span class=\"v48_5_21\"><sup id=\"Gal.5.21\" class=\"v48_5_21\">21</sup>envy, drunkenness, orgies, and things like these. I warn you, as I warned you before, that those who do such things will not inherit the kingdom of God. </span><span class=\"v48_5_22\"><sup id=\"Gal.5.22\" class=\"v48_5_22\">22</sup>But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, </span><span class=\"v48_5_23\"><sup id=\"Gal.5.23\" class=\"v48_5_23\">23</sup>gentleness, self-control; against such things there is no law. </span><span class=\"v48_5_24\"><sup id=\"Gal.5.24\" class=\"v48_5_24\">24</sup>And those who belong to Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with its passions and desires.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p\"><span class=\"v48_5_25\"><sup id=\"Gal.5.25\" class=\"v48_5_25\">25</sup>If we live by the Spirit, let us also keep in step with the Spirit. </span><span class=\"v48_5_26\"><sup id=\"Gal.5.26\" class=\"v48_5_26\">26</sup>Let us not become conceited, provoking one another, envying one another.</span></p>\n</div>\n",
