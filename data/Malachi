I have laid waste his hill country and left his heritage to jackals of the desert.\u201d </span><span class=\"v39_1_4\"><sup id=\"Mal.1.4\" class=\"v39_1_4\">4</sup>If Edom says, \u201cWe are shattered but we will rebuild the ruins,\u201d the <span class=\"nd\">Lord</span> of hosts says, \u201cThey may build, but I will tear down, and they will be called \u2018the wicked country,\u2019 and \u2018the people with whom the <span class=\"nd\">Lord</span> is angry forever.\u2019\u201d </span><span class=\"v39_1_5\"><sup id=\"Mal.1.5\" class=\"v39_1_5\">5</sup>Your own eyes shall see this, and you shall say, \u201cGreat is the <span class=\"nd\">Lord</span> beyond the border of Israel!\u201d</span></p>\n<h3 class=\"s1\">The Priests\u2019 Polluted Offerings</h3>\n<p class=\"p\"><span class=\"v39_1_6\"><sup id=\"Mal.1.6\" class=\"v39_1_6\">6</sup>\u201cA son honors his father, and a servant his master. If then I am a father, where is my honor? And if I am a master, where is my fear? says the <span class=\"nd\">Lord</span> of hosts to you, O priests, who despise my name. But you say, \u2018How have we despised your name?\u2019 </span><span class=\"v39_1_7\"><sup id=\"Mal.1.7\" class=\"v39_1_7\">7</sup>By offering polluted food upon my altar. But you say, \u2018How have we polluted you?\u2019 By saying that the <span class=\"nd\">Lord</span>\u2019s table may be despised. </span><span class=\"v39_1_8\"><sup id=\"Mal.1.8\" class=\"v39_1_8\">8</sup>When you offer blind animals in sacrifice, is that not evil? And when you offer those that are lame or sick, is that not evil? Present that to your governor; will he accept you or show you favor? says the <span class=\"nd\">Lord</span> of hosts. </span><span class=\"v39_1_9\"><sup id=\"Mal.1.9\" class=\"v39_1_9\">9</sup>And now entreat the favor of God, that he may be gracious to us.

I have no pleasure in you, says the <span class=\"nd\">Lord</span> of hosts, and I will not accept an offering from your hand. </span><span class=\"v39_1_11\"><sup id=\"Mal.1.11\" class=\"v39_1_11\">11</sup>For from the rising of the sun to its setting my name will be great among the nations, and in every place incense will be offered to my name, and a pure offering. For my name will be great among the nations, says the <span class=\"nd\">Lord</span> of hosts. </span><span class=\"v39_1_12\"><sup id=\"Mal.1.12\" class=\"v39_1_12\">12</sup>But you profane it when you say that the Lord\u2019s table is polluted, and its fruit, that is, its food may be despised. </span><span class=\"v39_1_13\"><sup id=\"Mal.1.13\" class=\"v39_1_13\">13</sup>But you say, \u2018What a weariness this is,\u2019 and you snort at it, says the <span class=\"nd\">Lord</span> of hosts. You bring what has been taken by violence or is lame or sick, and this you bring as your offering! Shall I accept that from your hand? says the <span class=\"nd\">Lord</span>. </span><span class=\"v39_1_14\"><sup id=\"Mal.1.14\" class=\"v39_1_14\">14</sup>Cursed be the cheat who has a male in his flock, and vows it, and yet sacrifices to the Lord what is blemished.

Indeed, I have already cursed them, because you do not lay it to heart. </span><span class=\"v39_2_3\"><sup id=\"Mal.2.3\" class=\"v39_2_3\">3</sup>Behold, I will rebuke your offspring, and spread dung on your faces, the dung of your offerings, and you shall be taken away with it. </span><span class=\"v39_2_4\"><sup id=\"Mal.2.4\" class=\"v39_2_4\">4</sup>So shall you know that I have sent this command to you, that my covenant with Levi may stand, says the <span class=\"nd\">Lord</span> of hosts. </span><span class=\"v39_2_5\"><sup id=\"Mal.2.5\" class=\"v39_2_5\">5</sup>My covenant with him was one of life and peace, and I gave them to him. It was a covenant of fear, and he feared me. He stood in awe of my name. </span><span class=\"v39_2_6\"><sup id=\"Mal.2.6\" class=\"v39_2_6\">6</sup>True instruction was in his mouth, and no wrong was found on his lips. He walked with me in peace and uprightness, and he turned many from iniquity. </span><span class=\"v39_2_7\"><sup id=\"Mal.2.7\" class=\"v39_2_7\">7</sup>For the lips of a priest should guard knowledge, and people should seek instruction from his mouth, for he is the messenger of the <span class=\"nd\">Lord</span> of hosts. </span><span class=\"v39_2_8\"><sup id=\"Mal.2.8\" class=\"v39_2_8\">8</sup>But you have turned aside from the way.

You have corrupted the covenant of Levi, says the <span class=\"nd\">Lord</span> of hosts, </span><span class=\"v39_2_9\"><sup id=\"Mal.2.9\" class=\"v39_2_9\">9</sup>and so I make you despised and abased before all the people, inasmuch as you do not keep my ways but show partiality in your instruction.\u201d</span></p>\n<h3 class=\"s1\">Judah Profaned the Covenant</h3>\n<p class=\"p\"><span class=\"v39_2_10\"><sup id=\"Mal.2.10\" class=\"v39_2_10\">10</sup>Have we not all one Father? Has not one God created us? Why then are we faithless to one another, profaning the covenant of our fathers? </span><span class=\"v39_2_11\"><sup id=\"Mal.2.11\" class=\"v39_2_11\">11</sup>Judah has been faithless, and abomination has been committed in Israel and in Jerusalem.

You cover the <span class=\"nd\">Lord</span>\u2019s altar with tears, with weeping and groaning because he no longer regards the offering or accepts it with favor from your hand. </span><span class=\"v39_2_14\"><sup id=\"Mal.2.14\" class=\"v39_2_14\">14</sup>But you say, \u201cWhy does he not?\u201d Because the <span class=\"nd\">Lord</span> was witness between you and the wife of your youth, to whom you have been faithless, though she is your companion and your wife by covenant. </span><span class=\"v39_2_15\"><sup id=\"Mal.2.15\" class=\"v39_2_15\">15</sup>Did he not make them one, with a portion of the Spirit in their union? And what was the one God seeking? Godly offspring. So guard yourselves in your spirit, and let none of you be faithless to the wife of your youth. </span><span class=\"v39_2_16\"><sup id=\"Mal.2.16\" class=\"v39_2_16\">16</sup>\u201cFor the man who does not love his wife but divorces her, says the <span class=\"nd\">Lord</span>, the God of Israel, covers his garment with violence, says the <span class=\"nd\">Lord</span> of hosts. So guard yourselves in your spirit, and do not be faithless.\u201d</span></p>\n<h3 class=\"s1\">The Messenger of the <span class=\"nd\">Lord</span>\n</h3>\n<p class=\"p\"><span class=\"v39_2_17\"><sup id=\"Mal.2.17\" class=\"v39_2_17\">17</sup>You have wearied the <span class=\"nd\">Lord</span> with your words. But you say, \u201cHow have we wearied him?\u201d By saying, \u201cEveryone who does evil is good in the sight of the <span class=\"nd\">Lord</span>, and he delights in them.\u201d Or by asking, \u201cWhere is the God of justice?\u201d</span></p>\n</div>\n",

I will be a swift witness against the sorcerers, against the adulterers, against those who swear falsely, against those who oppress the hired worker in his wages, the widow and the fatherless, against those who thrust aside the sojourner, and do not fear me, says the <span class=\"nd\">Lord</span> of hosts.</span></p>\n<h3 class=\"s1\">Robbing God</h3>\n<p class=\"p\"><span class=\"v39_3_6\"><sup id=\"Mal.3.6\" class=\"v39_3_6\">6</sup>\u201cFor I the <span class=\"nd\">Lord</span> do not change; therefore you, O children of Jacob, are not consumed. </span><span class=\"v39_3_7\"><sup id=\"Mal.3.7\" class=\"v39_3_7\">7</sup>From the days of your fathers you have turned aside from my statutes and have not kept them. Return to me, and I will return to you, says the <span class=\"nd\">Lord</span> of hosts. But you say, \u2018How shall we return?\u2019 </span><span class=\"v39_3_8\"><sup id=\"Mal.3.8\" class=\"v39_3_8\">8</sup>Will man rob God? Yet you are robbing me.

And thereby put me to the test, says the <span class=\"nd\">Lord</span> of hosts, if I will not open the windows of heaven for you and pour down for you a blessing until there is no more need. </span><span class=\"v39_3_11\"><sup id=\"Mal.3.11\" class=\"v39_3_11\">11</sup>I will rebuke the devourer for you, so that it will not destroy the fruits of your soil, and your vine in the field shall not fail to bear, says the <span class=\"nd\">Lord</span> of hosts. </span><span class=\"v39_3_12\"><sup id=\"Mal.3.12\" class=\"v39_3_12\">12</sup>Then all nations will call you blessed, for you will be a land of delight, says the <span class=\"nd\">Lord</span> of hosts.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p\"><span class=\"v39_3_13\"><sup id=\"Mal.3.13\" class=\"v39_3_13\">13</sup>\u201cYour words have been hard against me, says the <span class=\"nd\">Lord</span>. But you say, \u2018How have we spoken against you?\u2019 </span><span class=\"v39_3_14\"><sup id=\"Mal.3.14\" class=\"v39_3_14\">14</sup>You have said, \u2018It is vain to serve God.
