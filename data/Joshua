Therefore it shall be a witness against you, lest you deal falsely with your God.\u201d </span><span class=\"v6_24_28\"><sup id=\"Josh.24.28\" class=\"v6_24_28\">28</sup>So Joshua sent the people away, every man to his inheritance.</span></p>\n<h3 class=\"s1\">Joshua\u2019s Death and Burial</h3>\n<p class=\"p\"><span class=\"v6_24_29\"><sup id=\"Josh.24.29\" class=\"v6_24_29\">29</sup>After these things Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of the <span class=\"nd\">Lord</span>, died, being 110 years old. </span><span class=\"v6_24_30\"><sup id=\"Josh.24.30\" class=\"v6_24_30\">30</sup>And they buried him in his own inheritance at Timnath-serah, which is in the hill country of Ephraim, north of the mountain of Gaash.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p\"><span class=\"v6_24_31\"><sup id=\"Josh.24.31\" class=\"v6_24_31\">31</sup>Israel served the <span class=\"nd\">Lord</span> all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders who outlived Joshua and had known all the work that the <span class=\"nd\">Lord</span> did for Israel.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p\"><span class=\"v6_24_32\"><sup id=\"Josh.24.32\" class=\"v6_24_32\">32</sup>As for the bones of Joseph, which the people of Israel brought up from Egypt, they buried them at Shechem, in the piece of land that Jacob bought from the sons of Hamor the father of Shechem for a hundred pieces of money.
