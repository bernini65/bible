Only that in every way, whether in pretense or in truth, Christ is proclaimed, and in that I rejoice.</span></p>\n<h3 class=\"s1\">To Live Is Christ</h3>\n<p class=\"p\"><span class=\"v50_1_18\">Yes, and I will rejoice, </span><span class=\"v50_1_19\"><sup id=\"Phil.1.19\" class=\"v50_1_19\">19</sup>for I know that through your prayers and the help of the Spirit of Jesus Christ this will turn out for my deliverance, </span><span class=\"v50_1_20\"><sup id=\"Phil.1.20\" class=\"v50_1_20\">20</sup>as it is my eager expectation and hope that I will not be at all ashamed, but that with full courage now as always Christ will be honored in my body, whether by life or by death. </span><span class=\"v50_1_21\"><sup id=\"Phil.1.21\" class=\"v50_1_21\">21</sup>For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain. </span><span class=\"v50_1_22\"><sup id=\"Phil.1.22\" class=\"v50_1_22\">22</sup>If I am to live in the flesh, that means fruitful labor for me. Yet which I shall choose I cannot tell. </span><span class=\"v50_1_23\"><sup id=\"Phil.1.23\" class=\"v50_1_23\">23</sup>I am hard pressed between the two. My desire is to depart and be with Christ, for that is far better. </span><span class=\"v50_1_24\"><sup id=\"Phil.1.24\" class=\"v50_1_24\">24</sup>But to remain in the flesh is more necessary on your account. </span><span class=\"v50_1_25\"><sup id=\"Phil.1.25\" class=\"v50_1_25\">25</sup>Convinced of this, I know that I will remain and continue with you all, for your progress and joy in the faith, </span><span class=\"v50_1_26\"><sup id=\"Phil.1.26\" class=\"v50_1_26\">26</sup>so that in me you may have ample cause to glory in Christ Jesus, because of my coming to you again.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p\"><span class=\"v50_1_27\"><sup id=\"Phil.1.27\" class=\"v50_1_27\">27</sup>Only let your manner of life be worthy of the gospel of Christ, so that whether I come and see you or am absent, I may hear of you that you are standing firm in one spirit, with one mind striving side by side for the faith of the gospel, </span><span class=\"v50_1_28\"><sup id=\"Phil.1.28\" class=\"v50_1_28\">28</sup>and not frightened in anything by your opponents. This is a clear sign to them of their destruction, but of your salvation, and that from God. </span><span class=\"v50_1_29\"><sup id=\"Phil.1.29\" class=\"v50_1_29\">29</sup>For it has been granted to you that for the sake of Christ you should not only believe in him but also suffer for his sake, </span><span class=\"v50_1_30\"><sup id=\"Phil.1.30\" class=\"v50_1_30\">30</sup>engaged in the same conflict that you saw I had and now hear that I still have.</span></p>\n</div>\n",

if there is any encouragement in Christ, any comfort from love, any participation in the Spirit, any affection and sympathy, </span><span class=\"v50_2_2\"><sup id=\"Phil.2.2\" class=\"v50_2_2\">2</sup>complete my joy by being of the same mind, having the same love, being in full accord and of one mind. </span><span class=\"v50_2_3\"><sup id=\"Phil.2.3\" class=\"v50_2_3\">3</sup>Do nothing from selfish ambition or conceit, but in humility count others more significant than yourselves. </span><span class=\"v50_2_4\"><sup id=\"Phil.2.4\" class=\"v50_2_4\">4</sup>Let each of you look not only to his own interests, but also to the interests of others. </span><span class=\"v50_2_5\"><sup id=\"Phil.2.5\" class=\"v50_2_5\">5</sup>Have this mind among yourselves, which is yours in Christ Jesus,</span><span class=\"v50_2_6\"><sup id=\"Phil.2.6\" class=\"v50_2_6\">6</sup>who, though he was in the form of God, did not count equality with God a thing to be grasped, </span><span class=\"v50_2_7\"><sup id=\"Phil.2.7\" class=\"v50_2_7\">7</sup>but emptied himself, by taking the form of a servant,being born in the likeness of men. </span><span class=\"v50_2_8\"><sup id=\"Phil.2.8\" class=\"v50_2_8\">8</sup>And being found in human form, he humbled himself by becoming obedient to the point of death, even death on a cross. </span><span class=\"v50_2_9\"><sup id=\"Phil.2.9\" class=\"v50_2_9\">9</sup>Therefore God has highly exalted him and bestowed on him the name that is above every name, </span><span class=\"v50_2_10\"><sup id=\"Phil.2.10\" class=\"v50_2_10\">10</sup>so that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, in heaven and on earth and under the earth, </span><span class=\"v50_2_11\"><sup

class=\"p\"><span class=\"v50_2_12\"><sup id=\"Phil.2.12\" class=\"v50_2_12\">12</sup>Therefore, my beloved, as you have always obeyed, so now, not only as in my presence but much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling, </span><span class=\"v50_2_13\"><sup id=\"Phil.2.13\" class=\"v50_2_13\">13</sup>for it is God who works in you, both to will and to work for his good pleasure.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p\"><span class=\"v50_2_14\"><sup id=\"Phil.2.14\" class=\"v50_2_14\">14</sup>Do all things without grumbling or disputing, </span><span class=\"v50_2_15\"><sup id=\"Phil.2.15\" class=\"v50_2_15\">15</sup>that you may be blameless and innocent, children of God without blemish in the midst of a crooked and twisted generation, among whom you shine as lights in the world, </span><span class=\"v50_2_16\"><sup id=\"Phil.2.16\" class=\"v50_2_16\">16</sup>holding fast to the word of life, so that in the day of Christ I may be proud that I did not run in vain or labor in vain. </span><span class=\"v50_2_17\"><sup id=\"Phil.2.17\" class=\"v50_2_17\">17</sup>Even if I am to be poured out as a drink offering upon the sacrificial offering of your faith, I am glad and rejoice with you all. </span><span class=\"v50_2_18\"><sup id=\"Phil.2.18\" class=\"v50_2_18\">18</sup>Likewise you also should be glad and rejoice with me.</span></p>\n<h3 class=\"s1\">Timothy and Epaphroditus</h3>\n<p class=\"p\"><span class=\"v50_2_19\"><sup id=\"Phil.2.19\" class=\"v50_2_19\">19</sup>I hope in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy to you soon, so that I too may be cheered by news of you. </span><span class=\"v50_2_20\"><sup id=\"Phil.2.20\" class=\"v50_2_20\">20</sup>For I have no one like him, who will be genuinely concerned for your welfare. </span><span class=\"v50_2_21\"><sup id=\"Phil.2.21\" class=\"v50_2_21\">21</sup>For they all seek their own interests, not those of Jesus Christ. </span><span class=\"v50_2_22\"><sup id=\"Phil.2.22\"

class=\"v50_2_23\">23</sup>I hope therefore to send him just as soon as I see how it will go with me, </span><span class=\"v50_2_24\"><sup id=\"Phil.2.24\" class=\"v50_2_24\">24</sup>and I trust in the Lord that shortly I myself will come also.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p\"><span class=\"v50_2_25\"><sup id=\"Phil.2.25\" class=\"v50_2_25\">25</sup>I have thought it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus my brother and fellow worker and fellow soldier, and your messenger and minister to my need, </span><span class=\"v50_2_26\"><sup id=\"Phil.2.26\" class=\"v50_2_26\">26</sup>for he has been longing for you all and has been distressed because you heard that he was ill. </span><span class=\"v50_2_27\"><sup id=\"Phil.2.27\" class=\"v50_2_27\">27</sup>Indeed he was ill, near to death. But God had mercy on him, and not only on him but on me also, lest I should have sorrow upon sorrow. </span><span class=\"v50_2_28\"><sup id=\"Phil.2.28\" class=\"v50_2_28\">28</sup>I am the more eager to send him, therefore, that you may rejoice at seeing him again, and that I may be less anxious. </span><span class=\"v50_2_29\"><sup id=\"Phil.2.29\" class=\"v50_2_29\">29</sup>So receive him in the Lord with all joy, and honor such men, </span><span class=\"v50_2_30\"><sup id=\"Phil.2.30\" class=\"v50_2_30\">30</sup>for he nearly died for the work of Christ, risking his life to complete what was lacking in your service to me.</span></p>\n</div>\n",
