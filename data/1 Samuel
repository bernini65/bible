The name of the one was Hannah, and the name of the other, Peninnah. And Peninnah had children, but Hannah had no children.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p\"><span class=\"v9_1_3\"><sup id=\"1Sam.1.3\" class=\"v9_1_3\">3</sup>Now this man used to go up year by year from his city to worship and to sacrifice to the <span class=\"nd\">Lord</span> of hosts at Shiloh, where the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were priests of the <span class=\"nd\">Lord</span>. </span><span class=\"v9_1_4\"><sup id=\"1Sam.1.4\" class=\"v9_1_4\">4</sup>On the day when Elkanah sacrificed, he would give portions to Peninnah his wife and to all her sons and daughters. </span><span class=\"v9_1_5\"><sup id=\"1Sam.1.5\" class=\"v9_1_5\">5</sup>But to Hannah he gave a double portion, because he loved her, though the <span class=\"nd\">Lord</span> had closed her womb. </span><span class=\"v9_1_6\"><sup id=\"1Sam.1.6\" class=\"v9_1_6\">6</sup>And her rival used to provoke her grievously to irritate her, because the <span class=\"nd\">Lord</span> had closed her womb. </span><span class=\"v9_1_7\"><sup id=\"1Sam.1.7\" class=\"v9_1_7\">7</sup>So it went on year by year. As often as she went up to the house of the <span class=\"nd\">Lord</span>, she used to provoke her. Therefore Hannah wept and would not eat. </span><span class=\"v9_1_8\"><sup id=\"1Sam.1.8\" class=\"v9_1_8\">8</sup>And Elkanah, her husband, said to her, \u201cHannah, why do you weep? And why do you not eat? And why is your heart sad? Am I not more to you than ten sons?\u201d</span></p>\n<p class=\"p\"><span class=\"v9_1_9\"><sup id=\"1Sam.1.9\" class=\"v9_1_9\">9</sup>After they had eaten and drunk in Shiloh, Hannah rose. Now Eli the priest was sitting on the seat beside the doorpost of the temple of the <span class=\"nd\">Lord</span>. </span><span class=\"v9_1_10\"><sup id=\"1Sam.1.10\" class=\"v9_1_10\">10</sup>She was deeply distressed and prayed to the <span class=\"nd\">Lord</span> and wept bitterly. </span><span class=\"v9_1_11\"><sup id=\"1Sam.1.11\" class=\"v9_1_11\">11</sup>And she vowed a vow and said, \u201cO <span class=\"nd\">Lord</span> of hosts, if you will indeed look on the affliction of your servant and remember me and not forget your servant, but will give to your servant a son, then I will give him to the <span class=\"nd\">Lord</span> all the days of his life, and no razor shall touch his head.\u201d</span></p>\n<p class=\"p\"><span class=\"v9_1_12\"><sup id=\"1Sam.1.12\" class=\"v9_1_12\">12</sup>As she continued praying before the <span class=\"nd\">Lord</span>, Eli observed her mouth. </span><span class=\"v9_1_13\"><sup id=\"1Sam.1.13\" class=\"v9_1_13\">13</sup>Hannah was speaking in her heart; only her lips moved, and her voice was not heard. Therefore Eli took her to be a drunken woman. </span><span class=\"v9_1_14\"><sup id=\"1Sam.1.14\" class=\"v9_1_14\">14</sup>And Eli said to her, \u201cHow long will you go on being drunk? Put your wine away from you.\u201d </span><span class=\"v9_1_15\"><sup id=\"1Sam.1.15\" class=\"v9_1_15\">15</sup>But Hannah answered, \u201cNo, my lord, I am a woman troubled in spirit. I have drunk neither wine nor strong drink, but I have been pouring out my soul before the <span class=\"nd\">Lord</span>. </span><span class=\"v9_1_16\"><sup id=\"1Sam.1.16\" class=\"v9_1_16\">16</sup>Do not regard your servant as a worthless woman, for all along I have been speaking out of my great anxiety and vexation.\u201d </span><span class=\"v9_1_17\"><sup id=\"1Sam.1.17\" class=\"v9_1_17\">17</sup>Then Eli answered, \u201cGo in peace, and the God of Israel grant your petition that you have made to him.\u201d </span><span class=\"v9_1_18\"><sup id=\"1Sam.1.18\" class=\"v9_1_18\">18</sup>And she said, \u201cLet your servant find favor in your eyes.\u201d Then the woman went her way and ate, and her face was no longer sad.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p\"><span class=\"v9_1_19\"><sup id=\"1Sam.1.19\" class=\"v9_1_19\">19</sup>They rose early in the morning and worshiped before the <span class=\"nd\">Lord</span>; then they went back to their house at Ramah. And Elkanah knew Hannah his wife, and the <span class=\"nd\">Lord</span>remembered her. </span><span class=\"v9_1_20\"><sup id=\"1Sam.1.20\" class=\"v9_1_20\">20</sup>And in due time Hannah conceived and bore a son, and she called his name Samuel, for she said, \u201cI have asked for him from the <span class=\"nd\">Lord</span>.\u201d</span></p>\n<h3 class=\"s1\">Samuel Given to the <span class=\"nd\">Lord</span>\n</h3>\n<p class=\"p\"><span class=\"v9_1_21\"><sup id=\"1Sam.1.21\" class=\"v9_1_21\">21</sup>The man Elkanah and all his house went up to offer to the <span class=\"nd\">Lord</span> the yearly sacrifice and to pay his vow. </span><span class=\"v9_1_22\"><sup id=\"1Sam.1.22\" class=\"v9_1_22\">22</sup>But Hannah did not go up, for she said to her husband, \u201cAs soon as the child is weaned, I will bring him, so that he may appear in the presence of the <span class=\"nd\">Lord</span> and dwell there forever.\u201d </span><span class=\"v9_1_23\"><sup id=\"1Sam.1.23\" class=\"v9_1_23\">23</sup>Elkanah her husband said to her, \u201cDo what seems best to you; wait until you have weaned him; only, may the <span class=\"nd\">Lord</span> establish his word.\u201d So the woman remained and nursed her son until she weaned him. </span><span class=\"v9_1_24\"><sup id=\"1Sam.1.24\" class=\"v9_1_24\">24</sup>And when she had weaned him, she took him up with her, along with a three-year-old bull, an ephah of flour, and a skin of wine, and she brought him to the house of the <span class=\"nd\">Lord</span> at Shiloh. And the child was young. </span><span class=\"v9_1_25\"><sup id=\"1Sam.1.25\" class=\"v9_1_25\">25</sup>Then they slaughtered the bull, and they brought the child to Eli. </span><span class=\"v9_1_26\"><sup id=\"1Sam.1.26\" class=\"v9_1_26\">26</sup>And she said, \u201cOh, my lord! As you live, my lord, I am the woman who was standing here in your presence, praying to the <span class=\"nd\">Lord</span>. </span><span class=\"v9_1_27\"><sup id=\"1Sam.1.27\" class=\"v9_1_27\">27</sup>For this child I prayed, and the <span class=\"nd\">Lord</span> has granted me my petition that I made to him. </span><span class=\"v9_1_28\"><sup id=\"1Sam.1.28\" class=\"v9_1_28\">28</sup>Therefore I have lent him to the <span class=\"nd\">Lord</span>. As long as he lives, he is lent to the <span class=\"nd\">Lord</span>.\u201d</span></p>\n<p class=\"p\"><span class=\"v9_1_28\">And he worshiped the <span class=\"nd\">Lord</span> there.</span></p>\n</div>\n",

They did not know the <span class=\"nd\">Lord</span>. </span><span class=\"v9_2_13\"><sup id=\"1Sam.2.13\" class=\"v9_2_13\">13</sup>The custom of the priests with the people was that when any man offered sacrifice, the priest\u2019s servant would come, while the meat was boiling, with a three-pronged fork in his hand, </span><span class=\"v9_2_14\"><sup id=\"1Sam.2.14\" class=\"v9_2_14\">14</sup>and he would thrust it into the pan or kettle or cauldron or pot.
