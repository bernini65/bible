They were Ephrathites from Bethlehem in Judah. They went into the country of Moab and remained there. </span><span class=\"v8_1_3\"><sup id=\"Ruth.1.3\" class=\"v8_1_3\">3</sup>But Elimelech, the husband of Naomi, died, and she was left with her two sons. </span><span class=\"v8_1_4\"><sup id=\"Ruth.1.4\" class=\"v8_1_4\">4</sup>These took Moabite wives; the name of the one was Orpah and the name of the other Ruth. They lived there about ten years, </span><span class=\"v8_1_5\"><sup id=\"Ruth.1.5\" class=\"v8_1_5\">5</sup>and both Mahlon and Chilion died, so that the woman was left without her two sons and her husband.</span></p>\n<h3 class=\"s1\">Ruth\u2019s Loyalty to Naomi</h3>\n<p class=\"p\"><span class=\"v8_1_6\"><sup id=\"Ruth.1.6\" class=\"v8_1_6\">6</sup>Then she arose with her daughters-in-law to return from the country of Moab, for she had heard in the fields of Moab that the <span class=\"nd\">Lord</span> had visited his people and given them food. </span><span class=\"v8_1_7\"><sup id=\"Ruth.1.7\" class=\"v8_1_7\">7</sup>So she set out from the place where she was with her two daughters-in-law, and they went on the way to return to the land of Judah. </span><span class=\"v8_1_8\"><sup id=\"Ruth.1.8\" class=\"v8_1_8\">8</sup>But Naomi said to her two daughters-in-law, \u201cGo, return each of you to her mother\u2019s house. May the <span class=\"nd\">Lord</span> deal kindly with you, as you have dealt with the dead and with me. </span><span class=\"v8_1_9\"><sup id=\"Ruth.1.9\" class=\"v8_1_9\">9</sup>The <span class=\"nd\">Lord</span> grant that you may find rest, each of you in the house of her husband!\u201d Then she kissed them, and they lifted up their voices and wept. </span><span class=\"v8_1_10\"><sup id=\"Ruth.1.10\" class=\"v8_1_10\">10</sup>And they said to her, \u201cNo, we will return with you to your people.\u201d </span><span class=\"v8_1_11\"><sup id=\"Ruth.1.11\" class=\"v8_1_11\">11</sup>But Naomi said, \u201cTurn back, my daughters; why will you go with me? Have I yet sons in my womb that they may become your husbands? </span><span class=\"v8_1_12\"><sup id=\"Ruth.1.12\" class=\"v8_1_12\">12</sup>Turn back, my daughters; go your way, for I am too old to have a husband. If I should say I have hope, even if I should have a husband this night and should bear sons, </span><span class=\"v8_1_13\"><sup id=\"Ruth.1.13\" class=\"v8_1_13\">13</sup>would you therefore wait till they were grown? Would you therefore refrain from marrying? No, my daughters, for it is exceedingly bitter to me for your sake that the hand of the <span class=\"nd\">Lord</span> has gone out against me.\u201d </span><span class=\"v8_1_14\"><sup id=\"Ruth.1.14\" class=\"v8_1_14\">14</sup>Then they lifted up their voices and wept again. And Orpah kissed her mother-in-law, but Ruth clung to her.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p\"><span class=\"v8_1_15\"><sup id=\"Ruth.1.15\" class=\"v8_1_15\">15</sup>And she said, \u201cSee, your sister-in-law has gone back to her people and to her gods; return after your sister-in-law.\u201d </span><span class=\"v8_1_16\"><sup id=\"Ruth.1.16\" class=\"v8_1_16\">16</sup>But Ruth said, \u201cDo not urge me to leave you or to return from following you. For where you go I will go, and where you lodge I will lodge. Your people shall be my people, and your God my God. </span><span class=\"v8_1_17\"><sup id=\"Ruth.1.17\" class=\"v8_1_17\">17</sup>Where you die I will die, and there will I be buried. May the <span class=\"nd\">Lord</span> do so to me and more also if anything but death parts me from you.\u201d </span><span class=\"v8_1_18\"><sup id=\"Ruth.1.18\" class=\"v8_1_18\">18</sup>And when Naomi saw that she was determined to go with her, she said no more.</span></p>\n<h3 class=\"s1\">Naomi and Ruth Return</h3>\n<p class=\"p\"><span class=\"v8_1_19\"><sup id=\"Ruth.1.19\" class=\"v8_1_19\">19</sup>So the two of them went on until they came to Bethlehem. And when they came to Bethlehem, the whole town was stirred because of them. And the women said, \u201cIs this Naomi?\u201d </span><span class=\"v8_1_20\"><sup id=\"Ruth.1.20\" class=\"v8_1_20\">20</sup>She said to them, \u201cDo not call me Naomi; call me Mara, for the Almighty has dealt very bitterly with me. </span><span class=\"v8_1_21\"><sup id=\"Ruth.1.21\" class=\"v8_1_21\">21</sup>I went away full, and the <span class=\"nd\">Lord</span> has brought me back empty. Why call me Naomi, when the <span class=\"nd\">Lord</span> has testified against me and the Almighty has brought calamity upon me?\u201d</span></p>\n<p class=\"p\"><span class=\"v8_1_22\"><sup id=\"Ruth.1.22\" class=\"v8_1_22\">22</sup>So Naomi returned, and Ruth the Moabite her daughter-in-law with her, who returned from the country of Moab.

Have I not charged the young men not to touch you? And when you are thirsty, go to the vessels and drink what the young men have drawn.\u201d </span><span class=\"v8_2_10\"><sup id=\"Ruth.2.10\" class=\"v8_2_10\">10</sup>Then she fell on her face, bowing to the ground, and said to him, \u201cWhy have I found favor in your eyes, that you should take notice of me, since I am a foreigner?\u201d </span><span class=\"v8_2_11\"><sup id=\"Ruth.2.11\" class=\"v8_2_11\">11</sup>But Boaz answered her, \u201cAll that you have done for your mother-in-law since the death of your husband has been fully told to me, and how you left your father and mother and your native land and came to a people that you did not know before. </span><span class=\"v8_2_12\"><sup id=\"Ruth.2.12\" class=\"v8_2_12\">12</sup>The <span class=\"nd\">Lord</span> repay you for what you have done, and a full reward be given you by the <span class=\"nd\">Lord</span>, the God of Israel, under whose wings you have come to take refuge!\u201d </span><span class=\"v8_2_13\"><sup id=\"Ruth.2.13\" class=\"v8_2_13\">13</sup>Then she said, \u201cI have found favor in your eyes, my lord, for you have comforted me and spoken kindly to your servant, though I am not one of your servants.\u201d</span></p>\n<p class=\"p\"><span class=\"v8_2_14\"><sup id=\"Ruth.2.14\" class=\"v8_2_14\">14</sup>And at mealtime Boaz said to her, \u201cCome here and eat some bread and dip your morsel in the wine.\u201d So she sat beside the reapers, and he passed to her roasted grain. And she ate until she was satisfied, and she had some left over. </span><span class=\"v8_2_15\"><sup id=\"Ruth.2.15\" class=\"v8_2_15\">15</sup>When she rose to glean, Boaz instructed his young men, saying, \u201cLet her glean even among the sheaves, and do not reproach her. </span><span class=\"v8_2_16\"><sup id=\"Ruth.2.16\" class=\"v8_2_16\">16</sup>And also pull out some from the bundles for her and leave it for her to glean, and do not rebuke her.\u201d</span></p>\n<p class=\"p\"><span class=\"v8_2_17\"><sup id=\"Ruth.2.17\" class=\"v8_2_17\">17</sup>So she gleaned in the field until evening.

Her mother-in-law saw what she had gleaned. She also brought out and gave her what food she had left over after being satisfied. </span><span class=\"v8_2_19\"><sup id=\"Ruth.2.19\" class=\"v8_2_19\">19</sup>And her mother-in-law said to her, \u201cWhere did you glean today? And where have you worked? Blessed be the man who took notice of you.\u201d So she told her mother-in-law with whom she had worked and said, \u201cThe man\u2019s name with whom I worked today is Boaz.\u201d </span><span class=\"v8_2_20\"><sup id=\"Ruth.2.20\" class=\"v8_2_20\">20</sup>And Naomi said to her daughter-in-law, \u201cMay he be blessed by the <span class=\"nd\">Lord</span>, whose kindness has not forsaken the living or the dead!\u201d Naomi also said to her, \u201cThe man is a close relative of ours, one of our redeemers.\u201d </span><span class=\"v8_2_21\"><sup id=\"Ruth.2.21\" class=\"v8_2_21\">21</sup>And Ruth the Moabite said, \u201cBesides, he said to me, \u2018You shall keep close by my young men until they have finished all my harvest.\u2019\u201d </span><span class=\"v8_2_22\"><sup id=\"Ruth.2.22\" class=\"v8_2_22\">22</sup>And Naomi said to Ruth, her daughter-in-law, \u201cIt is good, my daughter, that you go out with his young women, lest in another field you be assaulted.\u201d </span><span class=\"v8_2_23\"><sup id=\"Ruth.2.23\" class=\"v8_2_23\">23</sup>So she kept close to the young women of Boaz, gleaning until the end of the barley and wheat harvests.
