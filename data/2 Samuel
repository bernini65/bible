He was with David when they defied the Philistines who were gathered there for battle, and the men of Israel withdrew. </span><span class=\"v10_23_10\"><sup id=\"2Sam.23.10\" class=\"v10_23_10\">10</sup>He rose and struck down the Philistines until his hand was weary, and his hand clung to the sword. And the <span class=\"nd\">Lord</span> brought about a great victory that day, and the men returned after him only to strip the slain.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p\"><span class=\"v10_23_11\"><sup id=\"2Sam.23.11\" class=\"v10_23_11\">11</sup>And next to him was Shammah, the son of Agee the Hararite. The Philistines gathered together at Lehi, where there was a plot of ground full of lentils, and the men fled from the Philistines. </span><span class=\"v10_23_12\"><sup id=\"2Sam.23.12\" class=\"v10_23_12\">12</sup>But he took his stand in the midst of the plot and defended it and struck down the Philistines, and the <span class=\"nd\">Lord</span> worked a great victory.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p\"><span class=\"v10_23_13\"><sup id=\"2Sam.23.13\" class=\"v10_23_13\">13</sup>And three of the thirty chief men went down and came about harvest time to David at the cave of Adullam, when a band of Philistines was encamped in the Valley of Rephaim. </span><span class=\"v10_23_14\"><sup id=\"2Sam.23.14\" class=\"v10_23_14\">14</sup>David was then in the stronghold, and the garrison of the Philistines was then at Bethlehem. </span><span class=\"v10_23_15\"><sup id=\"2Sam.23.15\" class=\"v10_23_15\">15</sup>And David said longingly, \u201cOh, that someone would give me water to drink from the well of Bethlehem that is by the gate!\u201d </span><span class=\"v10_23_16\"><sup id=\"2Sam.23.16\" class=\"v10_23_16\">16</sup>Then the three mighty men broke through the camp of the Philistines and drew water out of the well of Bethlehem that was by the gate and carried and brought it to David. But he would not drink of it. He poured it out to the <span class=\"nd\">Lord</span> </span><span class=\"v10_23_17\"><sup id=\"2Sam.23.17\" class=\"v10_23_17\">17</sup>and said, \u201cFar be it from me, O <span class=\"nd\">Lord</span>, that I should do this. Shall I drink the blood of the men who went at the risk of their lives?\u201d Therefore he would not drink it. These things the three mighty men did.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p\"><span class=\"v10_23_18\"><sup id=\"2Sam.23.18\" class=\"v10_23_18\">18</sup>Now Abishai, the brother of Joab, the son of Zeruiah, was chief of the thirty. And he wielded his spear against three hundred men and killed them and won a name beside the three. </span><span class=\"v10_23_19\"><sup id=\"2Sam.23.19\" class=\"v10_23_19\">19</sup>He was the most renowned of the thirty and became their commander, but he did not attain to the three.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p\"><span class=\"v10_23_20\"><sup id=\"2Sam.23.20\" class=\"v10_23_20\">20</sup>And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was a valiant man of Kabzeel, a doer of great deeds. He struck down two ariels of Moab. He also went down and struck down a lion in a pit on a day when snow had fallen. </span><span class=\"v10_23_21\"><sup id=\"2Sam.23.21\" class=\"v10_23_21\">21</sup>And he struck down an Egyptian, a handsome man. The Egyptian had a spear in his hand, but Benaiah went down to him with a staff and snatched the spear out of the Egyptian\u2019s hand and killed him with his own spear. </span><span class=\"v10_23_22\"><sup id=\"2Sam.23.22\" class=\"v10_23_22\">22</sup>These things did Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and won a name beside the three mighty men. </span><span class=\"v10_23_23\"><sup id=\"2Sam.23.23\" class=\"v10_23_23\">23</sup>He was renowned among the thirty, but he did not attain to the three.

So Joab and the commanders of the army went out from the presence of the king to number the people of Israel. </span><span class=\"v10_24_5\"><sup id=\"2Sam.24.5\" class=\"v10_24_5\">5</sup>They crossed the Jordan and began from Aroer, and from the city that is in the middle of the valley, toward Gad and on to Jazer. </span><span class=\"v10_24_6\"><sup id=\"2Sam.24.6\" class=\"v10_24_6\">6</sup>Then they came to Gilead, and to Kadesh in the land of the Hittites; and they came to Dan, and from Dan they went around to Sidon, </span><span class=\"v10_24_7\"><sup id=\"2Sam.24.7\" class=\"v10_24_7\">7</sup>and came to the fortress of Tyre and to all the cities of the Hivites and Canaanites; and they went out to the Negeb of Judah at Beersheba. </span><span class=\"v10_24_8\"><sup id=\"2Sam.24.8\" class=\"v10_24_8\">8</sup>So when they had gone through all the land, they came to Jerusalem at the end of nine months and twenty days. </span><span class=\"v10_24_9\"><sup id=\"2Sam.24.9\" class=\"v10_24_9\">9</sup>And Joab gave the sum of the numbering of the people to the king: in Israel there were 800,000 valiant men who drew the sword, and the men of Judah were 500,000.</span></p>\n<h3 class=\"s1\">The <span class=\"nd\">Lord</span>\u2019s Judgment of David\u2019s Sin</h3>\n<p class=\"p\"><span class=\"v10_24_10\"><sup id=\"2Sam.24.10\" class=\"v10_24_10\">10</sup>But David\u2019s heart struck him after he had numbered the people. And David said to the <span class=\"nd\">Lord</span>, \u201cI have sinned greatly in what I have done. But now, O <span class=\"nd\">Lord</span>, please take away the iniquity of your servant, for I have done very foolishly.\u201d </span><span class=\"v10_24_11\"><sup id=\"2Sam.24.11\" class=\"v10_24_11\">11</sup>And when David arose in the morning, the word of the <span class=\"nd\">Lord</span> came to the prophet Gad, David\u2019s seer, saying, </span><span class=\"v10_24_12\"><sup id=\"2Sam.24.12\" class=\"v10_24_12\">12</sup>\u201cGo and say to David, \u2018Thus says the <span class=\"nd\">Lord</span>, Three things I offer you.

Or will you flee three months before your foes while they pursue you? Or shall there be three days\u2019 pestilence in your land? Now consider, and decide what answer I shall return to him who sent me.\u201d </span><span class=\"v10_24_14\"><sup id=\"2Sam.24.14\" class=\"v10_24_14\">14</sup>Then David said to Gad, \u201cI am in great distress.

Please let your hand be against me and against my father\u2019s house.\u201d</span></p>\n<h3 class=\"s1\">David Builds an Altar</h3>\n<p class=\"p\"><span class=\"v10_24_18\"><sup id=\"2Sam.24.18\" class=\"v10_24_18\">18</sup>And Gad came that day to David and said to him, \u201cGo up, raise an altar to the <span class=\"nd\">Lord</span> on the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite.\u201d </span><span class=\"v10_24_19\"><sup id=\"2Sam.24.19\" class=\"v10_24_19\">19</sup>So David went up at Gad\u2019s word, as the <span class=\"nd\">Lord</span> commanded. </span><span class=\"v10_24_20\"><sup id=\"2Sam.24.20\" class=\"v10_24_20\">20</sup>And when Araunah looked down, he saw the king and his servants coming on toward him. And Araunah went out and paid homage to the king with his face to the ground. </span><span class=\"v10_24_21\"><sup id=\"2Sam.24.21\" class=\"v10_24_21\">21</sup>And Araunah said, \u201cWhy has my lord the king come to his servant?\u201d David said, \u201cTo buy the threshing floor from you, in order to build an altar to the <span class=\"nd\">Lord</span>, that the plague may be averted from the people.\u201d </span><span class=\"v10_24_22\"><sup id=\"2Sam.24.22\" class=\"v10_24_22\">22</sup>Then Araunah said to David, \u201cLet my lord the king take and offer up what seems good to him. Here are the oxen for the burnt offering and the threshing sledges and the yokes of the oxen for the wood. </span><span class=\"v10_24_23\"><sup id=\"2Sam.24.23\" class=\"v10_24_23\">23</sup>All this, O king, Araunah gives to the king.\u201d And Araunah said to the king, \u201cMay the <span class=\"nd\">Lord</span> your God accept you.\u201d </span><span class=\"v10_24_24\"><sup id=\"2Sam.24.24\" class=\"v10_24_24\">24</sup>But the king said to Araunah, \u201cNo, but I will buy it from you for a price. I will not offer burnt offerings to the <span class=\"nd\">Lord</span> my God that cost me nothing.\u201d So David bought the threshing floor and the oxen for fifty shekels of silver. </span><span class=\"v10_24_25\"><sup id=\"2Sam.24.25\" class=\"v10_24_25\">25</sup>And David built there an altar to the <span class=\"nd\">Lord</span> and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings. So the <span class=\"nd\">Lord</span> responded to the plea for the land, and the plague was averted from Israel.</span></p>\n</div>\n",
