Clothe yourselves, all of you, with humility toward one another, for \u201cGod opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble.\u201d</span></p>\n<p class=\"p\"><span class=\"v60_5_6\"><sup id=\"1Pet.5.6\" class=\"v60_5_6\">6</sup>Humble yourselves, therefore, under the mighty hand of God so that at the proper time he may exalt you, </span><span class=\"v60_5_7\"><sup id=\"1Pet.5.7\" class=\"v60_5_7\">7</sup>casting all your anxieties on him, because he cares for you. </span><span class=\"v60_5_8\"><sup id=\"1Pet.5.8\" class=\"v60_5_8\">8</sup>Be sober-minded; be watchful. Your adversary the devil prowls around like a roaring lion, seeking someone to devour. </span><span class=\"v60_5_9\"><sup id=\"1Pet.5.9\" class=\"v60_5_9\">9</sup>Resist him, firm in your faith, knowing that the same kinds of suffering are being experienced by your brotherhood throughout the world. </span><span class=\"v60_5_10\"><sup id=\"1Pet.5.10\" class=\"v60_5_10\">10</sup>And after you have suffered a little while, the God of all grace, who has called you to his eternal glory in Christ, will himself restore, confirm, strengthen, and establish you. </span><span class=\"v60_5_11\"><sup id=\"1Pet.5.11\" class=\"v60_5_11\">11</sup>To him be the dominion forever and ever. Amen.</span></p>\n<h3 class=\"s1\">Final Greetings</h3>\n<p class=\"p\"><span class=\"v60_5_12\"><sup id=\"1Pet.5.12\" class=\"v60_5_12\">12</sup>By Silvanus, a faithful brother as I regard him, I have written briefly to you, exhorting and declaring that this is the true grace of God. Stand firm in it. </span><span class=\"v60_5_13\"><sup id=\"1Pet.5.13\" class=\"v60_5_13\">13</sup>She who is at Babylon, who is likewise chosen, sends you greetings, and so does Mark, my son. </span><span class=\"v60_5_14\"><sup id=\"1Pet.5.14\" class=\"v60_5_14\">14</sup>Greet one another with the kiss of love.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p\"><span class=\"v60_5_14\">Peace to all of you who are in Christ.</span></p>\n</div>\n",
