You will do well to send them on their journey in a manner worthy of God. </span><span class=\"v64_1_7\"><sup id=\"3John.1.7\" class=\"v64_1_7\">7</sup>For they have gone out for the sake of the name, accepting nothing from the Gentiles. </span><span class=\"v64_1_8\"><sup id=\"3John.1.8\" class=\"v64_1_8\">8</sup>Therefore we ought to support people like these, that we may be fellow workers for the truth.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p\"><span class=\"v64_1_9\"><sup id=\"3John.1.9\" class=\"v64_1_9\">9</sup>I have written something to the church, but Diotrephes, who likes to put himself first, does not acknowledge our authority. </span><span class=\"v64_1_10\"><sup id=\"3John.1.10\" class=\"v64_1_10\">10</sup>So if I come, I will bring up what he is doing, talking wicked nonsense against us. And not content with that, he refuses to welcome the brothers, and also stops those who want to and puts them out of the church.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p\"><span class=\"v64_1_11\"><sup id=\"3John.1.11\" class=\"v64_1_11\">11</sup>Beloved, do not imitate evil but imitate good. Whoever does good is from God; whoever does evil has not seen God. </span><span class=\"v64_1_12\"><sup id=\"3John.1.12\" class=\"v64_1_12\">12</sup>Demetrius has received a good testimony from everyone, and from the truth itself. We also add our testimony, and you know that our testimony is true.</span></p>\n<h3 class=\"s1\">Final Greetings</h3>\n<p class=\"p\"><span class=\"v64_1_13\"><sup id=\"3John.1.13\" class=\"v64_1_13\">13</sup>I had much to write to you, but I would rather not write with pen and ink. </span><span class=\"v64_1_14\"><sup id=\"3John.1.14\" class=\"v64_1_14\">14</sup>I hope to see you soon, and we will talk face to face.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p\"><span class=\"v64_1_15\"><sup id=\"3John.1.15\" class=\"v64_1_15\">15</sup>Peace be to you. The friends greet you. Greet the friends, each by name.</span></p>\n</div>\n",
