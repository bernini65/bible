But they were seeking to kill him. </span><span class=\"v44_9_30\"><sup id=\"Acts.9.30\" class=\"v44_9_30\">30</sup>And when the brothers learned this, they brought him down to Caesarea and sent him off to Tarsus.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p\"><span class=\"v44_9_31\"><sup id=\"Acts.9.31\" class=\"v44_9_31\">31</sup>So the church throughout all Judea and Galilee and Samaria had peace and was being built up.

She was full of good works and acts of charity. </span><span class=\"v44_9_37\"><sup id=\"Acts.9.37\" class=\"v44_9_37\">37</sup>In those days she became ill and died, and when they had washed her, they laid her in an upper room. </span><span class=\"v44_9_38\"><sup id=\"Acts.9.38\" class=\"v44_9_38\">38</sup>Since Lydda was near Joppa, the disciples, hearing that Peter was there, sent two men to him, urging him, \u201cPlease come to us without delay.\u201d </span><span class=\"v44_9_39\"><sup id=\"Acts.9.39\" class=\"v44_9_39\">39</sup>So Peter rose and went with them.

All the widows stood beside him weeping and showing tunics and other garments that Dorcas made while she was with them. </span><span class=\"v44_9_40\"><sup id=\"Acts.9.40\" class=\"v44_9_40\">40</sup>But Peter put them all outside, and knelt down and prayed; and turning to the body he said, \u201cTabitha, arise.\u201d And she opened her eyes, and when she saw Peter she sat up. </span><span class=\"v44_9_41\"><sup id=\"Acts.9.41\" class=\"v44_9_41\">41</sup>And he gave her his hand and raised her up. Then calling the saints and widows, he presented her alive. </span><span class=\"v44_9_42\"><sup id=\"Acts.9.42\" class=\"v44_9_42\">42</sup>And it became known throughout all Joppa, and many believed in the Lord. </span><span class=\"v44_9_43\"><sup id=\"Acts.9.43\" class=\"v44_9_43\">43</sup>And he stayed in Joppa for many days with one Simon, a tanner.</span></p>\n</div>\n",

But if there is nothing to their charges against me, no one can give me up to them. I appeal to Caesar.\u201d </span><span class=\"v44_25_12\"><sup id=\"Acts.25.12\" class=\"v44_25_12\">12</sup>Then Festus, when he had conferred with his council, answered, \u201cTo Caesar you have appealed; to Caesar you shall go.\u201d</span></p>\n<h3 class=\"s1\">Paul Before Agrippa and Bernice</h3>\n<p class=\"p\"><span class=\"v44_25_13\"><sup id=\"Acts.25.13\" class=\"v44_25_13\">13</sup>Now when some days had passed, Agrippa the king and Bernice arrived at Caesarea and greeted Festus. </span><span class=\"v44_25_14\"><sup id=\"Acts.25.14\" class=\"v44_25_14\">14</sup>And as they stayed there many days, Festus laid Paul\u2019s case before the king, saying, \u201cThere is a man left prisoner by Felix, </span><span class=\"v44_25_15\"><sup id=\"Acts.25.15\" class=\"v44_25_15\">15</sup>and when I was at Jerusalem, the chief priests and the elders of the Jews laid out their case against him, asking for a sentence of condemnation against him. </span><span class=\"v44_25_16\"><sup id=\"Acts.25.16\" class=\"v44_25_16\">16</sup>I answered them that it was not the custom of the Romans to give up anyone before the accused met the accusers face to face and had opportunity to make his defense concerning the charge laid against him. </span><span class=\"v44_25_17\"><sup id=\"Acts.25.17\" class=\"v44_25_17\">17</sup>So when they came together here, I made no delay, but on the next day took my seat on the tribunal and ordered the man to be brought. </span><span class=\"v44_25_18\"><sup id=\"Acts.25.18\" class=\"v44_25_18\">18</sup>When the accusers stood up, they brought no charge in his case of such evils as I supposed. </span><span class=\"v44_25_19\"><sup id=\"Acts.25.19\" class=\"v44_25_19\">19</sup>Rather they had certain points of dispute with him about their own religion and about a certain Jesus, who was dead, but whom Paul asserted to be alive. </span><span class=\"v44_25_20\"><sup id=\"Acts.25.20\" class=\"v44_25_20\">20</sup>Being at a loss how to investigate these questions, I asked whether he wanted to go to Jerusalem and be tried there regarding them. </span><span class=\"v44_25_21\"><sup id=\"Acts.25.21\" class=\"v44_25_21\">21</sup>But when Paul had appealed to be kept in custody for the decision of the emperor, I ordered him to be held until I could send him to Caesar.\u201d </span><span class=\"v44_25_22\"><sup id=\"Acts.25.22\" class=\"v44_25_22\">22</sup>Then Agrippa said to Festus, \u201cI would like to hear the man myself.\u201d \u201cTomorrow,\u201d said he, \u201cyou will hear him.\u201d</span></p>\n<p class=\"p\"><span class=\"v44_25_23\"><sup id=\"Acts.25.23\" class=\"v44_25_23\">23</sup>So on the next day Agrippa and Bernice came with great pomp, and they entered the audience hall with the military tribunes and the prominent men of the city. Then, at the command of Festus, Paul was brought in. </span><span class=\"v44_25_24\"><sup id=\"Acts.25.24\" class=\"v44_25_24\">24</sup>And Festus said, \u201cKing Agrippa and all who are present with us, you see this man about whom the whole Jewish people petitioned me, both in Jerusalem and here, shouting that he ought not to live any longer. </span><span class=\"v44_25_25\"><sup id=\"Acts.25.25\" class=\"v44_25_25\">25</sup>But I found that he had done nothing deserving death.

And Julius treated Paul kindly and gave him leave to go to his friends and be cared for. </span><span class=\"v44_27_4\"><sup id=\"Acts.27.4\" class=\"v44_27_4\">4</sup>And putting out to sea from there we sailed under the lee of Cyprus, because the winds were against us. </span><span class=\"v44_27_5\"><sup id=\"Acts.27.5\" class=\"v44_27_5\">5</sup>And when we had sailed across the open sea along the coast of Cilicia and Pamphylia, we came to Myra in Lycia. </span><span class=\"v44_27_6\"><sup id=\"Acts.27.6\" class=\"v44_27_6\">6</sup>There the centurion found a ship of Alexandria sailing for Italy and put us on board. </span><span class=\"v44_27_7\"><sup id=\"Acts.27.7\" class=\"v44_27_7\">7</sup>We sailed slowly for a number of days and arrived with difficulty off Cnidus, and as the wind did not allow us to go farther, we sailed under the lee of Crete off Salmone. </span><span class=\"v44_27_8\"><sup id=\"Acts.27.8\" class=\"v44_27_8\">8</sup>Coasting along it with difficulty, we came to a place called Fair Havens, near which was the city of Lasea.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p\"><span class=\"v44_27_9\"><sup id=\"Acts.27.9\" class=\"v44_27_9\">9</sup>Since much time had passed, and the voyage was now dangerous because even the Fast was already over, Paul advised them, </span><span class=\"v44_27_10\"><sup id=\"Acts.27.10\" class=\"v44_27_10\">10</sup>saying, \u201cSirs, I perceive that the voyage will be with injury and much loss, not only of the cargo and the ship, but also of our lives.\u201d </span><span class=\"v44_27_11\"><sup id=\"Acts.27.11\" class=\"v44_27_11\">11</sup>But the centurion paid more attention to the pilot and to the owner of the ship than to what Paul said. </span><span class=\"v44_27_12\"><sup id=\"Acts.27.12\" class=\"v44_27_12\">12</sup>And because the harbor was not suitable to spend the winter in, the majority decided to put out to sea from there, on the chance that somehow they could reach Phoenix, a harbor of Crete, facing both southwest and northwest, and spend the winter there.</span></p>\n<h3 class=\"s1\">The Storm at Sea</h3>\n<p class=\"p\"><span class=\"v44_27_13\"><sup id=\"Acts.27.13\" class=\"v44_27_13\">13</sup>Now when the south wind blew gently, supposing that they had obtained their purpose, they weighed anchor and sailed along Crete, close to the shore. </span><span class=\"v44_27_14\"><sup id=\"Acts.27.14\" class=\"v44_27_14\">14</sup>But soon a tempestuous wind, called the northeaster, struck down from the land. </span><span class=\"v44_27_15\"><sup id=\"Acts.27.15\" class=\"v44_27_15\">15</sup>And when the ship was caught and could not face the wind, we gave way to it and were driven along. </span><span class=\"v44_27_16\"><sup id=\"Acts.27.16\" class=\"v44_27_16\">16</sup>Running under the lee of a small island called Cauda, we managed with difficulty to secure the ship\u2019s boat. </span><span class=\"v44_27_17\"><sup id=\"Acts.27.17\" class=\"v44_27_17\">17</sup>After hoisting it up, they used supports to undergird the ship. Then, fearing that they would run aground on the Syrtis, they lowered the gear, and thus they were driven along. </span><span class=\"v44_27_18\"><sup id=\"Acts.27.18\" class=\"v44_27_18\">18</sup>Since we were violently storm-tossed, they began the next day to jettison the cargo. </span><span class=\"v44_27_19\"><sup id=\"Acts.27.19\" class=\"v44_27_19\">19</sup>And on the third day they threw the ship\u2019s tackle overboard with their own hands. </span><span class=\"v44_27_20\"><sup id=\"Acts.27.20\" class=\"v44_27_20\">20</sup>When neither sun nor stars appeared for many days, and no small tempest lay on us, all hope of our being saved was at last abandoned.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p\"><span class=\"v44_27_21\"><sup id=\"Acts.27.21\" class=\"v44_27_21\">21</sup>Since they had been without food for a long time, Paul stood up among them and said, \u201cMen, you should have listened to me and not have set sail from Crete and incurred this injury and loss. </span><span class=\"v44_27_22\"><sup id=\"Acts.27.22\" class=\"v44_27_22\">22</sup>Yet now I urge you to take heart, for there will be no loss of life among you, but only of the ship. </span><span class=\"v44_27_23\"><sup id=\"Acts.27.23\" class=\"v44_27_23\">23</sup>For this very night there stood before me an angel of the God to whom I belong and whom I worship, </span><span class=\"v44_27_24\"><sup id=\"Acts.27.24\" class=\"v44_27_24\">24</sup>and he said, \u2018Do not be afraid, Paul; you must stand before Caesar. And behold, God has granted you all those who sail with you.\u2019 </span><span class=\"v44_27_25\"><sup id=\"Acts.27.25\" class=\"v44_27_25\">25</sup>So take heart, men, for I have faith in God that it will be exactly as I have been told. </span><span class=\"v44_27_26\"><sup id=\"Acts.27.26\" class=\"v44_27_26\">26</sup>But we must run aground on some island.\u201d</span></p>\n<p class=\"p\"><span class=\"v44_27_27\"><sup id=\"Acts.27.27\" class=\"v44_27_27\">27</sup>When the fourteenth night had come, as we were being driven across the Adriatic Sea, about midnight the sailors suspected that they were nearing land. </span><span class=\"v44_27_28\"><sup id=\"Acts.27.28\" class=\"v44_27_28\">28</sup>So they took a sounding and found twenty fathoms. A little farther on they took a sounding again and found fifteen fathoms. </span><span class=\"v44_27_29\"><sup id=\"Acts.27.29\" class=\"v44_27_29\">29</sup>And fearing that we might run on the rocks, they let down four anchors from the stern and prayed for day to come. </span><span class=\"v44_27_30\"><sup id=\"Acts.27.30\" class=\"v44_27_30\">30</sup>And as the sailors were seeking to escape from the ship, and had lowered the ship\u2019s boat into the sea under pretense of laying out anchors from the bow, </span><span class=\"v44_27_31\"><sup id=\"Acts.27.31\" class=\"v44_27_31\">31</sup>Paul said to the centurion and the soldiers, \u201cUnless these men stay in the ship, you cannot be saved.\u201d </span><span class=\"v44_27_32\"><sup id=\"Acts.27.32\" class=\"v44_27_32\">32</sup>Then the soldiers cut away the ropes of the ship\u2019s boat and let it go.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p\"><span class=\"v44_27_33\"><sup id=\"Acts.27.33\" class=\"v44_27_33\">33</sup>As day was about to dawn, Paul urged them all to take some food, saying, \u201cToday is the fourteenth day that you have continued in suspense and without food, having taken nothing. </span><span class=\"v44_27_34\"><sup id=\"Acts.27.34\" class=\"v44_27_34\">34</sup>Therefore I urge you to take some food. For it will give you strength, for not a hair is to perish from the head of any of you.\u201d </span><span class=\"v44_27_35\"><sup id=\"Acts.27.35\" class=\"v44_27_35\">35</sup>And when he had said these things, he took bread, and giving thanks to God in the presence of all he broke it and began to eat. </span><span class=\"v44_27_36\"><sup id=\"Acts.27.36\" class=\"v44_27_36\">36</sup>Then they all were encouraged and ate some food themselves. </span><span class=\"v44_27_37\"><sup id=\"Acts.27.37\" class=\"v44_27_37\">37</sup>(We were in all 276 persons in the ship.) </span><span class=\"v44_27_38\"><sup id=\"Acts.27.38\" class=\"v44_27_38\">38</sup>And when they had eaten enough, they lightened the ship, throwing out the wheat into the sea.</span></p>\n<h3 class=\"s1\">The Shipwreck</h3>\n<p class=\"p\"><span class=\"v44_27_39\"><sup id=\"Acts.27.39\" class=\"v44_27_39\">39</sup>Now when it was day, they did not recognize the land, but they noticed a bay with a beach, on which they planned if possible to run the ship ashore. </span><span class=\"v44_27_40\"><sup id=\"Acts.27.40\" class=\"v44_27_40\">40</sup>So they cast off the anchors and left them in the sea, at the same time loosening the ropes that tied the rudders. Then hoisting the foresail to the wind they made for the beach. </span><span class=\"v44_27_41\"><sup id=\"Acts.27.41\" class=\"v44_27_41\">41</sup>But striking a reef,they ran the vessel aground. The bow stuck and remained immovable, and the stern was being broken up by the surf. </span><span class=\"v44_27_42\"><sup id=\"Acts.27.42\" class=\"v44_27_42\">42</sup>The soldiers\u2019 plan was to kill the prisoners, lest any should swim away and escape. </span><span class=\"v44_27_43\"><sup id=\"Acts.27.43\" class=\"v44_27_43\">43</sup>But the centurion, wishing to save Paul, kept them from carrying out their plan. He ordered those who could swim to jump overboard first and make for the land, </span><span class=\"v44_27_44\"><sup id=\"Acts.27.44\" class=\"v44_27_44\">44</sup>and the rest on planks or on pieces of the ship. And so it was that all were brought safely to land.</span></p>\n</div>\n",

Though he has escaped from the sea, Justice has not allowed him to live.\u201d </span><span class=\"v44_28_5\"><sup id=\"Acts.28.5\" class=\"v44_28_5\">5</sup>He, however, shook off the creature into the fire and suffered no harm. </span><span class=\"v44_28_6\"><sup id=\"Acts.28.6\" class=\"v44_28_6\">6</sup>They were waiting for him to swell up or suddenly fall down dead. But when they had waited a long time and saw no misfortune come to him, they changed their minds and said that he was a god.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p\"><span class=\"v44_28_7\"><sup id=\"Acts.28.7\" class=\"v44_28_7\">7</sup>Now in the neighborhood of that place were lands belonging to the chief man of the island, named Publius, who received us and entertained us hospitably for three days. </span><span class=\"v44_28_8\"><sup id=\"Acts.28.8\" class=\"v44_28_8\">8</sup>It happened that the father of Publius lay sick with fever and dysentery. And Paul visited him and prayed, and putting his hands on him healed him. </span><span class=\"v44_28_9\"><sup id=\"Acts.28.9\" class=\"v44_28_9\">9</sup>And when this had taken place, the rest of the people on the island who had diseases also came and were cured. </span><span class=\"v44_28_10\"><sup id=\"Acts.28.10\" class=\"v44_28_10\">10</sup>They also honored us greatly, and when we were about to sail, they put on board whatever we needed.</span></p>\n<h3 class=\"s1\">Paul Arrives at Rome</h3>\n<p class=\"p\"><span class=\"v44_28_11\"><sup id=\"Acts.28.11\" class=\"v44_28_11\">11</sup>After three months we set sail in a ship that had wintered in the island, a ship of Alexandria, with the twin gods as a figurehead. </span><span class=\"v44_28_12\"><sup id=\"Acts.28.12\" class=\"v44_28_12\">12</sup>Putting in at Syracuse, we stayed there for three days. </span><span class=\"v44_28_13\"><sup id=\"Acts.28.13\" class=\"v44_28_13\">13</sup>And from there we made a circuit and arrived at Rhegium. And after one day a south wind sprang up, and on the second day we came to Puteoli. </span><span class=\"v44_28_14\"><sup id=\"Acts.28.14\" class=\"v44_28_14\">14</sup>There we found brothers and were invited to stay with them for seven days. And so we came to Rome. </span><span class=\"v44_28_15\"><sup id=\"Acts.28.15\" class=\"v44_28_15\">15</sup>And the brothers there, when they heard about us, came as far as the Forum of Appius and Three Taverns to meet us. On seeing them, Paul thanked God and took courage. </span><span class=\"v44_28_16\"><sup id=\"Acts.28.16\" class=\"v44_28_16\">16</sup>And when we came into Rome, Paul was allowed to stay by himself, with the soldier who guarded him.</span></p>\n<h3 class=\"s1\">Paul in Rome</h3>\n<p class=\"p\"><span class=\"v44_28_17\"><sup id=\"Acts.28.17\" class=\"v44_28_17\">17</sup>After three days he called together the local leaders of the Jews, and when they had gathered, he said to them, \u201cBrothers, though I had done nothing against our people or the customs of our fathers, yet I was delivered as a prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans. </span><span class=\"v44_28_18\"><sup id=\"Acts.28.18\" class=\"v44_28_18\">18</sup>When they had examined me, they wished to set me at liberty, because there was no reason for the death penalty in my case. </span><span class=\"v44_28_19\"><sup id=\"Acts.28.19\" class=\"v44_28_19\">19</sup>But because the Jews objected, I was compelled to appeal to Caesar\u2014though I had no charge to bring against my nation. </span><span class=\"v44_28_20\"><sup id=\"Acts.28.20\" class=\"v44_28_20\">20</sup>For this reason, therefore, I have asked to see you and speak with you, since it is because of the hope of Israel that I am wearing this chain.\u201d </span><span class=\"v44_28_21\"><sup id=\"Acts.28.21\" class=\"v44_28_21\">21</sup>And they said to him, \u201cWe have received no letters from Judea about you, and none of the brothers coming here has reported or spoken any evil about you. </span><span class=\"v44_28_22\"><sup id=\"Acts.28.22\" class=\"v44_28_22\">22</sup>But we desire to hear from you what your views are, for with regard to this sect we know that everywhere it is spoken against.\u201d</span></p>\n<p class=\"p\"><span class=\"v44_28_23\"><sup id=\"Acts.28.23\" class=\"v44_28_23\">23</sup>When they had appointed a day for him, they came to him at his lodging in greater numbers. From morning till evening he expounded to them, testifying to the kingdom of God and trying to convince them about Jesus both from the Law of Moses and from the Prophets. </span><span class=\"v44_28_24\"><sup id=\"Acts.28.24\" class=\"v44_28_24\">24</sup>And some were convinced by what he said, but others disbelieved. </span><span class=\"v44_28_25\"><sup id=\"Acts.28.25\" class=\"v44_28_25\">25</sup>And disagreeing among themselves, they departed after Paul had made one statement: \u201cThe Holy Spirit was right in saying to your fathers through Isaiah the prophet:</span></p>\n<p class=\"b\"></p>\n<p class=\"q1\"><span class=\"v44_28_26\"><sup id=\"Acts.28.26\" class=\"v44_28_26\">26</sup>\u201c\u2018Go to this people, and say,</span></p>\n<p class=\"q1\"><span class=\"v44_28_26\">\u201cYou will indeed hear but never understand,</span></p>\n<p class=\"q2\"><span class=\"v44_28_26\">and you will indeed see but never perceive.\u201d</span></p>\n<p class=\"q1\"><span class=\"v44_28_27\"><sup id=\"Acts.28.27\" class=\"v44_28_27\">27</sup>For this people\u2019s heart has grown dull,</span></p>\n<p class=\"q2\"><span class=\"v44_28_27\">and with their ears they can barely hear,</span></p>\n<p class=\"q2\"><span class=\"v44_28_27\">and their eyes they have closed;</span></p>\n<p class=\"q1\"><span class=\"v44_28_27\">lest they should see with their eyes</span></p>\n<p class=\"q2\"><span class=\"v44_28_27\">and hear with their ears</span></p>\n<p class=\"q1\"><span class=\"v44_28_27\">and understand with their heart</span></p>\n<p class=\"q2\"><span class=\"v44_28_27\">and turn, and I would heal them.\u2019</span></p>\n<p class=\"b\"></p>\n<p class=\"m\"><span class=\"v44_28_28\"><sup id=\"Acts.28.28\" class=\"v44_28_28\">28</sup>Therefore let it be known to you that this salvation of God has been sent to the Gentiles; they will listen.\u201d</span></p>\n<p class=\"p\"><span class=\"v44_28_30\"><sup id=\"Acts.28.30\" class=\"v44_28_30\">30</sup>He lived there two whole years at his own expense, and welcomed all who came to him, </span><span class=\"v44_28_31\"><sup id=\"Acts.28.31\" class=\"v44_28_31\">31</sup>proclaiming the kingdom of God and teaching about the Lord Jesus Christ with all boldness and without hindrance.</span></p>\n</div>\n",
