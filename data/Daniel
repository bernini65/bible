He got down on his knees three times a day and prayed and gave thanks before his God, as he had done previously. </span><span class=\"v27_6_11\"><sup id=\"Dan.6.11\" class=\"v27_6_11\">11</sup>Then these men came by agreement and found Daniel making petition and plea before his God. </span><span class=\"v27_6_12\"><sup id=\"Dan.6.12\" class=\"v27_6_12\">12</sup>Then they came near and said before the king, concerning the injunction, \u201cO king!

And he labored till the sun went down to rescue him. </span><span class=\"v27_6_15\"><sup id=\"Dan.6.15\" class=\"v27_6_15\">15</sup>Then these men came by agreement to the king and said to the king, \u201cKnow, O king, that it is a law of the Medes and Persians that no injunction or ordinance that the king establishes can be changed.\u201d</span></p>\n<p class=\"p\"><span class=\"v27_6_16\"><sup id=\"Dan.6.16\" class=\"v27_6_16\">16</sup>Then the king commanded, and Daniel was brought and cast into the den of lions.
