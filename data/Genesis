And since they bred when they came to drink, </span><span class=\"v0_30_39\"><sup id=\"Gen.30.39\" class=\"v0_30_39\">39</sup>the flocks bred in front of the sticks and so the flocks brought forth striped, speckled, and spotted. </span><span class=\"v0_30_40\"><sup id=\"Gen.30.40\" class=\"v0_30_40\">40</sup>And Jacob separated the lambs and set the faces of the flocks toward the striped and all the black in the flock of Laban. He put his own droves apart and did not put them with Laban\u2019s flock. </span><span class=\"v0_30_41\"><sup id=\"Gen.30.41\" class=\"v0_30_41\">41</sup>Whenever the stronger of the flock were breeding, Jacob would lay the sticks in the troughs before the eyes of the flock, that they might breed among the sticks, </span><span class=\"v0_30_42\"><sup id=\"Gen.30.42\" class=\"v0_30_42\">42</sup>but for the feebler of the flock he would not lay them there.
