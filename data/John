But the tunic was seamless, woven in one piece from top to bottom, </span><span class=\"v43_19_24\"><sup id=\"John.19.24\" class=\"v43_19_24\">24</sup>so they said to one another, \u201cLet us not tear it, but cast lots for it to see whose it shall be.\u201d This was to fulfill the Scripture which says,</span></p>\n<p class=\"b\"></p>\n<p class=\"q1\"><span class=\"v43_19_24\">\u201cThey divided my garments among them,</span></p>\n<p class=\"q2\"><span class=\"v43_19_24\">and for my clothing they cast lots.\u201d</span></p>\n<p class=\"b\"></p>\n<p class=\"m\"><span class=\"v43_19_24\">So the soldiers did these things, </span><span class=\"v43_19_25\"><sup id=\"John.19.25\" class=\"v43_19_25\">25</sup>but standing by the cross of Jesus were his mother and his mother\u2019s sister, Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene. </span><span class=\"v43_19_26\"><sup id=\"John.19.26\" class=\"v43_19_26\">26</sup>When Jesus saw his mother and the disciple whom he loved standing nearby, he said to his mother, <span class=\"wj\">\u201cWoman, behold, your son!\u201d</span> </span><span class=\"v43_19_27\"><sup id=\"John.19.27\" class=\"v43_19_27\">27</sup>Then he said to the disciple, <span class=\"wj\">\u201cBehold, your mother!\u201d</span> And from that hour the disciple took her to his own home.</span></p>\n<h3 class=\"s1\">The Death of Jesus</h3>\n<p class=\"p\"><span class=\"v43_19_28\"><sup id=\"John.19.28\" class=\"v43_19_28\">28</sup>After this, Jesus, knowing that all was now finished, said (to fulfill the Scripture), <span class=\"wj\">\u201cI thirst.\u201d</span></span><span class=\"v43_19_29\"><sup id=\"John.19.29\" class=\"v43_19_29\">29</sup>A jar full of sour wine stood there, so they put a sponge full of the sour wine on a hyssop branch and held it to his mouth. </span><span class=\"v43_19_30\"><sup id=\"John.19.30\" class=\"v43_19_30\">30</sup>When Jesus had received the sour wine, he said, <span class=\"wj\">\u201cIt is finished,\u201d</span> and he bowed his head and gave up his spirit.</span></p>\n<h3 class=\"s1\">Jesus\u2019 Side Is Pierced</h3>\n<p class=\"p\"><span class=\"v43_19_31\"><sup id=\"John.19.31\" class=\"v43_19_31\">31</sup>Since it was the day of Preparation, and so that the bodies would not remain on the cross on the Sabbath (for that Sabbath was a high day), the Jews asked Pilate that their legs might be broken and that they might be taken away. </span><span class=\"v43_19_32\"><sup id=\"John.19.32\" class=\"v43_19_32\">32</sup>So the soldiers came and broke the legs of the first, and of the other who had been crucified with him. </span><span class=\"v43_19_33\"><sup id=\"John.19.33\" class=\"v43_19_33\">33</sup>But when they came to Jesus and saw that he was already dead, they did not break his legs. </span><span class=\"v43_19_34\"><sup id=\"John.19.34\" class=\"v43_19_34\">34</sup>But one of the soldiers pierced his side with a spear, and at once there came out blood and water. </span><span class=\"v43_19_35\"><sup id=\"John.19.35\" class=\"v43_19_35\">35</sup>He who saw it has borne witness\u2014his testimony is true, and he knows that he is telling the truth\u2014that you also may believe. </span><span class=\"v43_19_36\"><sup id=\"John.19.36\" class=\"v43_19_36\">36</sup>For these things took place that the Scripture might be fulfilled: \u201cNot one of his bones will be broken.\u201d </span><span class=\"v43_19_37\"><sup id=\"John.19.37\" class=\"v43_19_37\">37</sup>And again another Scripture says, \u201cThey will look on him whom they have pierced.\u201d</span></p>\n<h3 class=\"s1\">Jesus Is Buried</h3>\n<p class=\"p\"><span class=\"v43_19_38\"><sup id=\"John.19.38\" class=\"v43_19_38\">38</sup>After these things Joseph of Arimathea, who was a disciple of Jesus, but secretly for fear of the Jews, asked Pilate that he might take away the body of Jesus, and Pilate gave him permission.

And although there were so many, the net was not torn. </span><span class=\"v43_21_12\"><sup id=\"John.21.12\" class=\"v43_21_12\">12</sup>Jesus said to them, <span class=\"wj\">\u201cCome and </span><span class=\"wj\">have breakfast.\u201d</span> Now none of the disciples dared ask him, \u201cWho are you?\u201d They knew it was the Lord. </span><span class=\"v43_21_13\"><sup id=\"John.21.13\" class=\"v43_21_13\">13</sup>Jesus came and took the bread and gave it to them, and so with the fish. </span><span class=\"v43_21_14\"><sup id=\"John.21.14\" class=\"v43_21_14\">14</sup>This was now the third time that Jesus was revealed to the disciples after he was raised from the dead.</span></p>\n<h3 class=\"s1\">Jesus and Peter</h3>\n<p class=\"p\"><span class=\"v43_21_15\"><sup id=\"John.21.15\" class=\"v43_21_15\">15</sup>When they had finished breakfast, Jesus said to Simon Peter, <span class=\"wj\">\u201cSimon, </span><span class=\"wj\">son of John, </span><span class=\"wj\">do you love me more than these?\u201d</span> He said to him, \u201cYes, Lord; you know that I love you.\u201d He said to him, <span class=\"wj\">\u201cFeed </span><span class=\"wj\">my lambs.\u201d</span> </span><span class=\"v43_21_16\"><sup id=\"John.21.16\" class=\"v43_21_16\">16</sup>He said to him a second time, <span class=\"wj\">\u201cSimon, son of John, do you love me?\u201d</span> He said to him, \u201cYes, Lord; you know that I love you.\u201d He said to him, <span class=\"wj\">\u201cTend </span><span class=\"wj\">my sheep.\u201d</span> </span><span class=\"v43_21_17\"><sup id=\"John.21.17\" class=\"v43_21_17\">17</sup>He said to him the third time, <span class=\"wj\">\u201cSimon, son of John, do you love me?\u201d</span> Peter was grieved because he said to him the third time, <span class=\"wj\">\u201cDo you love me?\u201d</span> and he said to him, \u201cLord, you know everything; you know that I love you.\u201d Jesus said to him, <span class=\"wj\">\u201cFeed </span><span class=\"wj\">my sheep.</span> </span><span class=\"v43_21_18\"><sup id=\"John.21.18\" class=\"v43_21_18\">18</sup><span class=\"wj\">Truly, truly, I say to you, when you were young, </span><span class=\"wj\">you used to dress yourself and walk wherever you wanted, but when you are old, you will stretch out your hands, and another will dress you and carry you where you do not want to go.\u201d</span> </span><span class=\"v43_21_19\"><sup id=\"John.21.19\" class=\"v43_21_19\">19</sup>(This he said to show by what kind of death he was to glorify God.) And after saying this he said to him, <span class=\"wj\">\u201cFollow me.\u201d</span></span></p>\n<h3 class=\"s1\">Jesus and the Beloved Apostle</h3>\n<p class=\"p\"><span class=\"v43_21_20\"><sup id=\"John.21.20\" class=\"v43_21_20\">20</sup>Peter turned and saw the disciple whom Jesus loved following them, the one who also had leaned back against him during the supper and had said, \u201cLord, who is it that is going to betray you?\u201d </span><span class=\"v43_21_21\"><sup id=\"John.21.21\" class=\"v43_21_21\">21</sup>When Peter saw him, he said to Jesus, \u201cLord, what about this man?\u201d </span><span class=\"v43_21_22\"><sup id=\"John.21.22\" class=\"v43_21_22\">22</sup>Jesus said to him, <span class=\"wj\">\u201cIf it is my will that he remain </span><span class=\"wj\">until </span><span class=\"wj\">I come, what is that to you? </span><span class=\"wj\">You follow me!\u201d</span> </span><span class=\"v43_21_23\"><sup id=\"John.21.23\" class=\"v43_21_23\">23</sup>So the saying spread abroad among the brothers that this disciple was not to die; yet Jesus did not say to him that he was not to die, but, <span class=\"wj\">\u201cIf it is my will that he remain until I come, what is that to you?\u201d</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"p\"><span class=\"v43_21_24\"><sup id=\"John.21.24\" class=\"v43_21_24\">24</sup>This is the disciple who is bearing witness about these things, and who has written these things, and we know that his testimony is true.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p\"><span class=\"v43_21_25\"><sup id=\"John.21.25\" class=\"v43_21_25\">25</sup>Now there are also many other things that Jesus did. Were every one of them to be written, I suppose that the world itself could not contain the books that would be written.</span></p>\n</div>\n",
