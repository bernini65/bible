Because of my house that lies in ruins, while each of you busies himself with his own house. </span><span class=\"v37_1_10\"><sup id=\"Hag.1.10\" class=\"v37_1_10\">10</sup>Therefore the heavens above you have withheld the dew, and the earth has withheld its produce. </span><span class=\"v37_1_11\"><sup id=\"Hag.1.11\" class=\"v37_1_11\">11</sup>And I have called for a drought on the land and the hills, on the grain, the new wine, the oil, on what the ground brings forth, on man and beast, and on all their labors.\u201d</span></p>\n<h3 class=\"s1\">The People Obey the <span class=\"nd\">Lord</span>\n</h3>\n<p class=\"p\"><span class=\"v37_1_12\"><sup id=\"Hag.1.12\" class=\"v37_1_12\">12</sup>Then Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest, with all the remnant of the people, obeyed the voice of the <span class=\"nd\">Lord</span> their God, and the words of Haggai the prophet, as the <span class=\"nd\">Lord</span> their God had sent him. And the people feared the <span class=\"nd\">Lord</span>. </span><span class=\"v37_1_13\"><sup id=\"Hag.1.13\" class=\"v37_1_13\">13</sup>Then Haggai, the messenger of the <span class=\"nd\">Lord</span>, spoke to the people with the <span class=\"nd\">Lord</span>\u2019s message, \u201cI am with you, declares the <span class=\"nd\">Lord</span>.\u201d </span><span class=\"v37_1_14\"><sup id=\"Hag.1.14\" class=\"v37_1_14\">14</sup>And the <span class=\"nd\">Lord</span> stirred up the spirit of Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and the spirit of Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest, and the spirit of all the remnant of the people. And they came and worked on the house of the <span class=\"nd\">Lord</span> of hosts, their God, </span><span class=\"v37_1_15\"><sup id=\"Hag.1.15\" class=\"v37_1_15\">15</sup>on the twenty-fourth day of the month, in the sixth month, in the second year of Darius the king.</span></p>\n</div>\n",
