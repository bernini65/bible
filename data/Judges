And I likewise will go with you into the territory allotted to you.\u201d So Simeon went with him. </span><span class=\"v7_1_4\"><sup id=\"Judg.1.4\" class=\"v7_1_4\">4</sup>Then Judah went up and the <span class=\"nd\">Lord</span> gave the Canaanites and the Perizzites into their hand, and they defeated 10,000 of them at Bezek. </span><span class=\"v7_1_5\"><sup id=\"Judg.1.5\" class=\"v7_1_5\">5</sup>They found Adoni-bezek at Bezek and fought against him and defeated the Canaanites and the Perizzites. </span><span class=\"v7_1_6\"><sup id=\"Judg.1.6\" class=\"v7_1_6\">6</sup>Adoni-bezek fled, but they pursued him and caught him and cut off his thumbs and his big toes. </span><span class=\"v7_1_7\"><sup id=\"Judg.1.7\" class=\"v7_1_7\">7</sup>And Adoni-bezek said, \u201cSeventy kings with their thumbs and their big toes cut off used to pick up scraps under my table.

(Now the name of the city was formerly Luz.) </span><span class=\"v7_1_24\"><sup id=\"Judg.1.24\" class=\"v7_1_24\">24</sup>And the spies saw a man coming out of the city, and they said to him, \u201cPlease show us the way into the city, and we will deal kindly with you.\u201d </span><span class=\"v7_1_25\"><sup id=\"Judg.1.25\" class=\"v7_1_25\">25</sup>And he showed them the way into the city. And they struck the city with the edge of the sword, but they let the man and all his family go. </span><span class=\"v7_1_26\"><sup id=\"Judg.1.26\" class=\"v7_1_26\">26</sup>And the man went to the land of the Hittites and built a city and called its name Luz.

They went after other gods, from among the gods of the peoples who were around them, and bowed down to them. And they provoked the <span class=\"nd\">Lord</span> to anger. </span><span class=\"v7_2_13\"><sup id=\"Judg.2.13\" class=\"v7_2_13\">13</sup>They abandoned the <span class=\"nd\">Lord</span> and served the Baals and the Ashtaroth. </span><span class=\"v7_2_14\"><sup id=\"Judg.2.14\" class=\"v7_2_14\">14</sup>So the anger of the <span class=\"nd\">Lord</span> was kindled against Israel, and he gave them over to plunderers, who plundered them.

All these were men who drew the sword. </span><span class=\"v7_20_26\"><sup id=\"Judg.20.26\" class=\"v7_20_26\">26</sup>Then all the people of Israel, the whole army, went up and came to Bethel and wept. They sat there before the <span class=\"nd\">Lord</span> and fasted that day until evening, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before the <span class=\"nd\">Lord</span>. </span><span class=\"v7_20_27\"><sup id=\"Judg.20.27\" class=\"v7_20_27\">27</sup>And the people of Israel inquired of the <span class=\"nd\">Lord</span> (for the ark of the covenant of God was there in those days, </span><span class=\"v7_20_28\"><sup id=\"Judg.20.28\" class=\"v7_20_28\">28</sup>and Phinehas the son of Eleazar, son of Aaron, ministered before it in those days), saying, \u201cShall we go out once more to battle against our brothers, the people of Benjamin, or shall we cease?\u201d And the <span class=\"nd\">Lord</span> said, \u201cGo up, for tomorrow I will give them into your hand.\u201d</span></p>\n<p class=\"p\"><span class=\"v7_20_29\"><sup id=\"Judg.20.29\" class=\"v7_20_29\">29</sup>So Israel set men in ambush around Gibeah. </span><span class=\"v7_20_30\"><sup id=\"Judg.20.30\" class=\"v7_20_30\">30</sup>And the people of Israel went up against the people of Benjamin on the third day and set themselves in array against Gibeah, as at other times. </span><span class=\"v7_20_31\"><sup id=\"Judg.20.31\" class=\"v7_20_31\">31</sup>And the people of Benjamin went out against the people and were drawn away from the city. And as at other times they began to strike and kill some of the people in the highways, one of which goes up to Bethel and the other to Gibeah, and in the open country, about thirty men of Israel. </span><span class=\"v7_20_32\"><sup id=\"Judg.20.32\" class=\"v7_20_32\">32</sup>And the people of Benjamin said, \u201cThey are routed before us, as at the first.\u201d But the people of Israel said, \u201cLet us flee and draw them away from the city to the highways.\u201d </span><span class=\"v7_20_33\"><sup id=\"Judg.20.33\" class=\"v7_20_33\">33</sup>And all the men of Israel rose up out of their place and set themselves in array at Baal-tamar, and the men of Israel who were in ambush rushed out of their place from Maareh-geba. </span><span class=\"v7_20_34\"><sup id=\"Judg.20.34\" class=\"v7_20_34\">34</sup>And there came against Gibeah 10,000 chosen men out of all Israel, and the battle was hard, but the Benjaminites did not know that disaster was close upon them. </span><span class=\"v7_20_35\"><sup id=\"Judg.20.35\" class=\"v7_20_35\">35</sup>And the <span class=\"nd\">Lord</span> defeated Benjamin before Israel, and the people of Israel destroyed 25,100 men of Benjamin that day. All these were men who drew the sword. </span><span class=\"v7_20_36\"><sup id=\"Judg.20.36\" class=\"v7_20_36\">36</sup>So the people of Benjamin saw that they were defeated.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p\"><span class=\"v7_20_36\">The men of Israel gave ground to Benjamin, because they trusted the men in ambush whom they had set against Gibeah. </span><span class=\"v7_20_37\"><sup id=\"Judg.20.37\" class=\"v7_20_37\">37</sup>Then the men in ambush hurried and rushed against Gibeah; the men in ambush moved out and struck all the city with the edge of the sword. </span><span class=\"v7_20_38\"><sup id=\"Judg.20.38\" class=\"v7_20_38\">38</sup>Now the appointed signal between the men of Israel and the men in the main ambush was that when they made a great cloud of smoke rise up out of the city </span><span class=\"v7_20_39\"><sup id=\"Judg.20.39\" class=\"v7_20_39\">39</sup>the men of Israel should turn in battle. Now Benjamin had begun to strike and kill about thirty men of Israel. They said, \u201cSurely they are defeated before us, as in the first battle.\u201d </span><span class=\"v7_20_40\"><sup id=\"Judg.20.40\" class=\"v7_20_40\">40</sup>But when the signal began to rise out of the city in a column of smoke, the Benjaminites looked behind them, and behold, the whole of the city went up in smoke to heaven. </span><span class=\"v7_20_41\"><sup id=\"Judg.20.41\" class=\"v7_20_41\">41</sup>Then the men of Israel turned, and the men of Benjamin were dismayed, for they saw that disaster was close upon them. </span><span class=\"v7_20_42\"><sup id=\"Judg.20.42\" class=\"v7_20_42\">42</sup>Therefore they turned their backs before the men of Israel in the direction of the wilderness, but the battle overtook them. And those who came out of the cities were destroying them in their midst. </span><span class=\"v7_20_43\"><sup id=\"Judg.20.43\" class=\"v7_20_43\">43</sup>Surrounding the Benjaminites, they pursued them and trod them down from Nohah as far as opposite Gibeah on the east. </span><span class=\"v7_20_44\"><sup id=\"Judg.20.44\" class=\"v7_20_44\">44</sup>Eighteen thousand men of Benjamin fell, all of them men of valor. </span><span class=\"v7_20_45\"><sup id=\"Judg.20.45\" class=\"v7_20_45\">45</sup>And they turned and fled toward the wilderness to the rock of Rimmon. Five thousand men of them were cut down in the highways. And they were pursued hard to Gidom, and 2,000 men of them were struck down. </span><span class=\"v7_20_46\"><sup id=\"Judg.20.46\" class=\"v7_20_46\">46</sup>So all who fell that day of Benjamin were 25,000 men who drew the sword, all of them men of valor. </span><span class=\"v7_20_47\"><sup id=\"Judg.20.47\" class=\"v7_20_47\">47</sup>But 600 men turned and fled toward the wilderness to the rock of Rimmon and remained at the rock of Rimmon four months. </span><span class=\"v7_20_48\"><sup id=\"Judg.20.48\" class=\"v7_20_48\">48</sup>And the men of Israel turned back against the people of Benjamin and struck them with the edge of the sword, the city, men and beasts and all that they found. And all the towns that they found they set on fire.</span></p>\n</div>\n",
