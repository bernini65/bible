For we were so utterly burdened beyond our strength that we despaired of life itself. </span><span class=\"v47_1_9\"><sup id=\"2Cor.1.9\" class=\"v47_1_9\">9</sup>Indeed, we felt that we had received the sentence of death. But that was to make us rely not on ourselves but on God who raises the dead. </span><span class=\"v47_1_10\"><sup id=\"2Cor.1.10\" class=\"v47_1_10\">10</sup>He delivered us from such a deadly peril, and he will deliver us. On him we have set our hope that he will deliver us again. </span><span class=\"v47_1_11\"><sup id=\"2Cor.1.11\" class=\"v47_1_11\">11</sup>You also must help us by prayer, so that many will give thanks on our behalf for the blessing granted us through the prayers of many.</span></p>\n<h3 class=\"s1\">Paul\u2019s Change of Plans</h3>\n<p class=\"p\"><span class=\"v47_1_12\"><sup id=\"2Cor.1.12\" class=\"v47_1_12\">12</sup>For our boast is this, the testimony of our conscience, that we behaved in the world with simplicity and godly sincerity, not by earthly wisdom but by the grace of God, and supremely so toward you. </span><span class=\"v47_1_13\"><sup id=\"2Cor.1.13\" class=\"v47_1_13\">13</sup>For we are not writing to you anything other than what you read and understand and I hope you will fully understand\u2014 </span><span class=\"v47_1_14\"><sup id=\"2Cor.1.14\" class=\"v47_1_14\">14</sup>just as you did partially understand us\u2014that on the day of our Lord Jesus you will boast of us as we will boast of you.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p\"><span class=\"v47_1_15\"><sup id=\"2Cor.1.15\" class=\"v47_1_15\">15</sup>Because I was sure of this, I wanted to come to you first, so that you might have a second experience of grace. </span><span class=\"v47_1_16\"><sup id=\"2Cor.1.16\" class=\"v47_1_16\">16</sup>I wanted to visit you on my way to Macedonia, and to come back to you from Macedonia and have you send me on my way to Judea. </span><span class=\"v47_1_17\"><sup id=\"2Cor.1.17\" class=\"v47_1_17\">17</sup>Was I vacillating when I wanted to do this? Do I make my plans according to the flesh, ready to say \u201cYes, yes\u201d and \u201cNo, no\u201d at the same time? </span><span class=\"v47_1_18\"><sup id=\"2Cor.1.18\" class=\"v47_1_18\">18</sup>As surely as God is faithful, our word to you has not been Yes and No. </span><span class=\"v47_1_19\"><sup id=\"2Cor.1.19\" class=\"v47_1_19\">19</sup>For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, whom we proclaimed among you, Silvanus and Timothy and I, was not Yes and No, but in him it is always Yes. </span><span class=\"v47_1_20\"><sup id=\"2Cor.1.20\" class=\"v47_1_20\">20</sup>For all the promises of God find their Yes in him. That is why it is through him that we utter our Amen to God for his glory. </span><span class=\"v47_1_21\"><sup id=\"2Cor.1.21\" class=\"v47_1_21\">21</sup>And it is God who establishes us with you in Christ, and has anointed us, </span><span class=\"v47_1_22\"><sup id=\"2Cor.1.22\" class=\"v47_1_22\">22</sup>and who has also put his seal on us and given us his Spirit in our hearts as a guarantee.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p\"><span class=\"v47_1_23\"><sup id=\"2Cor.1.23\" class=\"v47_1_23\">23</sup>But I call God to witness against me\u2014it was to spare you that I refrained from coming again to Corinth. </span><span class=\"v47_1_24\"><sup id=\"2Cor.1.24\" class=\"v47_1_24\">24</sup>Not that we lord it over your faith, but we work with you for your joy, for you stand firm in your faith.</span></p>\n</div>\n",

Indeed, what I have forgiven, if I have forgiven anything, has been for your sake in the presence of Christ, </span><span class=\"v47_2_11\"><sup id=\"2Cor.2.11\" class=\"v47_2_11\">11</sup>so that we would not be outwitted by Satan; for we are not ignorant of his designs.</span></p>\n<h3 class=\"s1\">Triumph in Christ</h3>\n<p class=\"p\"><span class=\"v47_2_12\"><sup id=\"2Cor.2.12\" class=\"v47_2_12\">12</sup>When I came to Troas to preach the gospel of Christ, even though a door was opened for me in the Lord, </span><span class=\"v47_2_13\"><sup id=\"2Cor.2.13\" class=\"v47_2_13\">13</sup>my spirit was not at rest because I did not find my brother Titus there. So I took leave of them and went on to Macedonia.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p\"><span class=\"v47_2_14\"><sup id=\"2Cor.2.14\" class=\"v47_2_14\">14</sup>But thanks be to God, who in Christ always leads us in triumphal procession, and through us spreads the fragrance of the knowledge of him everywhere. </span><span class=\"v47_2_15\"><sup id=\"2Cor.2.15\" class=\"v47_2_15\">15</sup>For we are the aroma of Christ to God among those who are being saved and among those who are perishing, </span><span class=\"v47_2_16\"><sup id=\"2Cor.2.16\" class=\"v47_2_16\">16</sup>to one a fragrance from death to death, to the other a fragrance from life to life. Who is sufficient for these things? </span><span class=\"v47_2_17\"><sup id=\"2Cor.2.17\" class=\"v47_2_17\">17</sup>For we are not, like so many, peddlers of God\u2019s word, but as men of sincerity, as commissioned by God, in the sight of God we speak in Christ.</span></p>\n</div>\n",
