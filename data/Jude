For they walked in the way of Cain and abandoned themselves for the sake of gain to Balaam\u2019s error and perished in Korah\u2019s rebellion. </span><span class=\"v65_1_12\"><sup id=\"Jude.1.12\" class=\"v65_1_12\">12</sup>These are hidden reefs at your love feasts, as they feast with you without fear, shepherds feeding themselves; waterless clouds, swept along by winds; fruitless trees in late autumn, twice dead, uprooted; </span><span class=\"v65_1_13\"><sup id=\"Jude.1.13\" class=\"v65_1_13\">13</sup>wild waves of the sea, casting up the foam of their own shame; wandering stars, for whom the gloom of utter darkness has been reserved forever.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p\"><span class=\"v65_1_14\"><sup id=\"Jude.1.14\" class=\"v65_1_14\">14</sup>It was also about these that Enoch, the seventh from Adam, prophesied, saying, \u201cBehold, the Lord comes with ten thousands of his holy ones, </span><span class=\"v65_1_15\"><sup id=\"Jude.1.15\" class=\"v65_1_15\">15</sup>to execute judgment on all and to convict all the ungodly of all their deeds of ungodliness that they have committed in such an ungodly way, and of all the harsh things that ungodly sinners have spoken against him.\u201d </span><span class=\"v65_1_16\"><sup id=\"Jude.1.16\" class=\"v65_1_16\">16</sup>These are grumblers, malcontents, following their own sinful desires; they are loud-mouthed boasters, showing favoritism to gain advantage.</span></p>\n<h3 class=\"s1\">A Call to Persevere</h3>\n<p class=\"p\"><span class=\"v65_1_17\"><sup id=\"Jude.1.17\" class=\"v65_1_17\">17</sup>But you must remember, beloved, the predictions of the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ. </span><span class=\"v65_1_18\"><sup id=\"Jude.1.18\" class=\"v65_1_18\">18</sup>They said to you, \u201cIn the last time there will be scoffers, following their own ungodly passions.\u201d </span><span class=\"v65_1_19\"><sup id=\"Jude.1.19\" class=\"v65_1_19\">19</sup>It is these who cause divisions, worldly people, devoid of the Spirit. </span><span class=\"v65_1_20\"><sup id=\"Jude.1.20\" class=\"v65_1_20\">20</sup>But you, beloved, building yourselves up in your most holy faith and praying in the Holy Spirit, </span><span class=\"v65_1_21\"><sup id=\"Jude.1.21\" class=\"v65_1_21\">21</sup>keep yourselves in the love of God, waiting for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ that leads to eternal life. </span><span class=\"v65_1_22\"><sup id=\"Jude.1.22\" class=\"v65_1_22\">22</sup>And have mercy on those who doubt; </span><span class=\"v65_1_23\"><sup id=\"Jude.1.23\" class=\"v65_1_23\">23</sup>save others by snatching them out of the fire; to others show mercy with fear, hating even the garment stained by the flesh.</span></p>\n<h3 class=\"s1\">Doxology</h3>\n<p class=\"p\"><span class=\"v65_1_24\"><sup id=\"Jude.1.24\" class=\"v65_1_24\">24</sup>Now to him who is able to keep you from stumbling and to present you blameless before the presence of his glory with great joy, </span><span class=\"v65_1_25\"><sup id=\"Jude.1.25\" class=\"v65_1_25\">25</sup>to the only God, our Savior, through Jesus Christ our Lord, be glory, majesty, dominion, and authority, before all time and now and forever. Amen.</span></p>\n</div>\n",
