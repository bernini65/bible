Are they not, my lord the king, all of them my lord\u2019s servants? Why then should my lord require this?

So Joab departed and went throughout all Israel and came back to Jerusalem. </span><span class=\"v13_21_5\"><sup id=\"1Chr.21.5\" class=\"v13_21_5\">5</sup>And Joab gave the sum of the numbering of the people to David. In all Israel there were 1,100,000 men who drew the sword, and in Judah 470,000 who drew the sword. </span><span class=\"v13_21_6\"><sup id=\"1Chr.21.6\" class=\"v13_21_6\">6</sup>But he did not include Levi and Benjamin in the numbering, for the king\u2019s command was abhorrent to Joab.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p\"><span class=\"v13_21_7\"><sup id=\"1Chr.21.7\" class=\"v13_21_7\">7</sup>But God was displeased with this thing, and he struck Israel. </span><span class=\"v13_21_8\"><sup id=\"1Chr.21.8\" class=\"v13_21_8\">8</sup>And David said to God, \u201cI have sinned greatly in that I have done this thing.

And he said to the angel who was working destruction, \u201cIt is enough; now stay your hand.\u201d And the angel of the <span class=\"nd\">Lord</span> was standing by the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite. </span><span class=\"v13_21_16\"><sup id=\"1Chr.21.16\" class=\"v13_21_16\">16</sup>And David lifted his eyes and saw the angel of the <span class=\"nd\">Lord</span> standing between earth and heaven, and in his hand a drawn sword stretched out over Jerusalem. Then David and the elders, clothed in sackcloth, fell upon their faces. </span><span class=\"v13_21_17\"><sup id=\"1Chr.21.17\" class=\"v13_21_17\">17</sup>And David said to God, \u201cWas it not I who gave command to number the people? It is I who have sinned and done great evil. But these sheep, what have they done? Please let your hand, O <span class=\"nd\">Lord</span> my God, be against me and against my father\u2019s house.

See, I give the oxen for burnt offerings and the threshing sledges for the wood and the wheat for a grain offering; I give it all.\u201d </span><span class=\"v13_21_24\"><sup id=\"1Chr.21.24\" class=\"v13_21_24\">24</sup>But King David said to Ornan, \u201cNo, but I will buy them for the full price. I will not take for the <span class=\"nd\">Lord</span> what is yours, nor offer burnt offerings that cost me nothing.\u201d </span><span class=\"v13_21_25\"><sup id=\"1Chr.21.25\" class=\"v13_21_25\">25</sup>So David paid Ornan 600 shekels of gold by weight for the site. </span><span class=\"v13_21_26\"><sup id=\"1Chr.21.26\" class=\"v13_21_26\">26</sup>And David built there an altar to the <span class=\"nd\">Lord</span> and presented burnt offerings and peace offerings and called on the <span class=\"nd\">Lord</span>, and the <span class=\"nd\">Lord</span> answered him with fire from heaven upon the altar of burnt offering. </span><span class=\"v13_21_27\"><sup id=\"1Chr.21.27\" class=\"v13_21_27\">27</sup>Then the <span class=\"nd\">Lord</span> commanded the angel, and he put his sword back into its sheath.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p\"><span class=\"v13_21_28\"><sup id=\"1Chr.21.28\" class=\"v13_21_28\">28</sup>At that time, when David saw that the <span class=\"nd\">Lord</span> had answered him at the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite, he sacrificed there. </span><span class=\"v13_21_29\"><sup id=\"1Chr.21.29\" class=\"v13_21_29\">29</sup>For the tabernacle of the <span class=\"nd\">Lord</span>, which Moses had made in the wilderness, and the altar of burnt offering were at that time in the high place at Gibeon, </span><span class=\"v13_21_30\"><sup id=\"1Chr.21.30\" class=\"v13_21_30\">30</sup>but David could not go before it to inquire of God, for he was afraid of the sword of the angel of the <span class=\"nd\">Lord</span>.</span></p>\n</div>\n",
