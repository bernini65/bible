He who loves his wife loves himself. </span><span class=\"v49_5_29\"><sup id=\"Eph.5.29\" class=\"v49_5_29\">29</sup>For no one ever hated his own flesh, but nourishes and cherishes it, just as Christ does the church, </span><span class=\"v49_5_30\"><sup id=\"Eph.5.30\" class=\"v49_5_30\">30</sup>because we are members of his body. </span><span class=\"v49_5_31\"><sup id=\"Eph.5.31\" class=\"v49_5_31\">31</sup>\u201cTherefore a man shall leave his father and mother and hold fast to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh.\u201d </span><span class=\"v49_5_32\"><sup id=\"Eph.5.32\" class=\"v49_5_32\">32</sup>This mystery is profound, and I am saying that it refers to Christ and the church. </span><span class=\"v49_5_33\"><sup id=\"Eph.5.33\" class=\"v49_5_33\">33</sup>However, let each one of you love his wife as himself, and let the wife see that she respects her husband.</span></p>\n</div>\n",
