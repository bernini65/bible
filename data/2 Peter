Their condemnation from long ago is not idle, and their destruction is not asleep.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p\"><span class=\"v61_2_4\"><sup id=\"2Pet.2.4\" class=\"v61_2_4\">4</sup>For if God did not spare angels when they sinned, but cast them into hell and committed them to chains of gloomy darkness to be kept until the judgment; </span><span class=\"v61_2_5\"><sup id=\"2Pet.2.5\" class=\"v61_2_5\">5</sup>if he did not spare the ancient world, but preserved Noah, a herald of righteousness, with seven others, when he brought a flood upon the world of the ungodly; </span><span class=\"v61_2_6\"><sup id=\"2Pet.2.6\" class=\"v61_2_6\">6</sup>if by turning the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah to ashes he condemned them to extinction, making them an example of what is going to happen to the ungodly; </span><span class=\"v61_2_7\"><sup id=\"2Pet.2.7\" class=\"v61_2_7\">7</sup>and if he rescued righteous Lot, greatly distressed by the sensual conduct of the wicked </span><span class=\"v61_2_8\"><sup id=\"2Pet.2.8\" class=\"v61_2_8\">8</sup>(for as that righteous man lived among them day after day, he was tormenting his righteous soul over their lawless deeds that he saw and heard); </span><span class=\"v61_2_9\"><sup id=\"2Pet.2.9\" class=\"v61_2_9\">9</sup>then the Lord knows how to rescue the godly from trials, and to keep the unrighteous under punishment until the day of judgment, </span><span class=\"v61_2_10\"><sup id=\"2Pet.2.10\" class=\"v61_2_10\">10</sup>and especially those who indulge in the lust of defiling passion and despise authority.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p\"><span class=\"v61_2_10\">Bold and willful, they do not tremble as they blaspheme the glorious ones, </span><span class=\"v61_2_11\"><sup id=\"2Pet.2.11\" class=\"v61_2_11\">11</sup>whereas angels, though greater in might and power, do not pronounce a blasphemous judgment against them before the Lord. </span><span class=\"v61_2_12\"><sup id=\"2Pet.2.12\" class=\"v61_2_12\">12</sup>But these, like irrational animals, creatures of instinct, born to be caught and destroyed, blaspheming about matters of which they are ignorant, will also be destroyed in their destruction, </span><span class=\"v61_2_13\"><sup id=\"2Pet.2.13\" class=\"v61_2_13\">13</sup>suffering wrong as the wage for their wrongdoing. They count it pleasure to revel in the daytime. They are blots and blemishes, reveling in their deceptions, while they feast with you. </span><span class=\"v61_2_14\"><sup id=\"2Pet.2.14\" class=\"v61_2_14\">14</sup>They have eyes full of adultery, insatiable for sin. They entice unsteady souls. They have hearts trained in greed. Accursed children! </span><span class=\"v61_2_15\"><sup id=\"2Pet.2.15\" class=\"v61_2_15\">15</sup>Forsaking the right way, they have gone astray. They have followed the way of Balaam, the son of Beor, who loved gain from wrongdoing, </span><span class=\"v61_2_16\"><sup id=\"2Pet.2.16\" class=\"v61_2_16\">16</sup>but was rebuked for his own transgression; a speechless donkey spoke with human voice and restrained the prophet\u2019s madness.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p\"><span class=\"v61_2_17\"><sup id=\"2Pet.2.17\" class=\"v61_2_17\">17</sup>These are waterless springs and mists driven by a storm. For them the gloom of utter darkness has been reserved. </span><span class=\"v61_2_18\"><sup id=\"2Pet.2.18\" class=\"v61_2_18\">18</sup>For, speaking loud boasts of folly, they entice by sensual passions of the flesh those who are barely escaping from those who live in error. </span><span class=\"v61_2_19\"><sup id=\"2Pet.2.19\" class=\"v61_2_19\">19</sup>They promise them freedom, but they themselves are slaves of corruption. For whatever overcomes a person, to that he is enslaved. </span><span class=\"v61_2_20\"><sup id=\"2Pet.2.20\" class=\"v61_2_20\">20</sup>For if, after they have escaped the defilements of the world through the knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, they are again entangled in them and overcome, the last state has become worse for them than the first. </span><span class=\"v61_2_21\"><sup id=\"2Pet.2.21\" class=\"v61_2_21\">21</sup>For it would have been better for them never to have known the way of righteousness than after knowing it to turn back from the holy commandment delivered to them. </span><span class=\"v61_2_22\"><sup id=\"2Pet.2.22\" class=\"v61_2_22\">22</sup>What the true proverb says has happened to them: \u201cThe dog returns to its own vomit, and the sow, after washing herself, returns to wallow in the mire.\u201d</span></p>\n</div>\n",

For ever since the fathers fell asleep, all things are continuing as they were from the beginning of creation.\u201d </span><span class=\"v61_3_5\"><sup id=\"2Pet.3.5\" class=\"v61_3_5\">5</sup>For they deliberately overlook this fact, that the heavens existed long ago, and the earth was formed out of water and through water by the word of God, </span><span class=\"v61_3_6\"><sup id=\"2Pet.3.6\" class=\"v61_3_6\">6</sup>and that by means of these the world that then existed was deluged with water and perished. </span><span class=\"v61_3_7\"><sup id=\"2Pet.3.7\" class=\"v61_3_7\">7</sup>But by the same word the heavens and earth that now exist are stored up for fire, being kept until the day of judgment and destruction of the ungodly.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p\"><span class=\"v61_3_8\"><sup id=\"2Pet.3.8\" class=\"v61_3_8\">8</sup>But do not overlook this one fact, beloved, that with the Lord one day is as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day. </span><span class=\"v61_3_9\"><sup id=\"2Pet.3.9\" class=\"v61_3_9\">9</sup>The Lord is not slow to fulfill his promise as some count slowness, but is patient toward you,not wishing that any should perish, but that all should reach repentance. </span><span class=\"v61_3_10\"><sup id=\"2Pet.3.10\" class=\"v61_3_10\">10</sup>But the day of the Lord will come like a thief, and then the heavens will pass away with a roar, and the heavenly bodies will be burned up and dissolved, and the earth and the works that are done on it will be exposed.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p\"><span class=\"v61_3_11\"><sup id=\"2Pet.3.11\" class=\"v61_3_11\">11</sup>Since all these things are thus to be dissolved, what sort of people ought you to be in lives of holiness and godliness, </span><span class=\"v61_3_12\"><sup id=\"2Pet.3.12\" class=\"v61_3_12\">12</sup>waiting for and hastening the coming of the day of God, because of which the heavens will be set on fire and dissolved, and the heavenly bodies will melt as they burn! </span><span class=\"v61_3_13\"><sup id=\"2Pet.3.13\" class=\"v61_3_13\">13</sup>But according to his promise we are waiting for new heavens and a new earth in which righteousness dwells.</span></p>\n<h3 class=\"s1\">Final Words</h3>\n<p class=\"p\"><span class=\"v61_3_14\"><sup id=\"2Pet.3.14\" class=\"v61_3_14\">14</sup>Therefore, beloved, since you are waiting for these, be diligent to be found by him without spot or blemish, and at peace. </span><span class=\"v61_3_15\"><sup id=\"2Pet.3.15\" class=\"v61_3_15\">15</sup>And count the patience of our Lord as salvation, just as our beloved brother Paul also wrote to you according to the wisdom given him, </span><span class=\"v61_3_16\"><sup id=\"2Pet.3.16\" class=\"v61_3_16\">16</sup>as he does in all his letters when he speaks in them of these matters. There are some things in them that are hard to understand, which the ignorant and unstable twist to their own destruction, as they do the other Scriptures. </span><span class=\"v61_3_17\"><sup id=\"2Pet.3.17\" class=\"v61_3_17\">17</sup>You therefore, beloved, knowing this beforehand, take care that you are not carried away with the error of lawless people and lose your own stability. </span><span class=\"v61_3_18\"><sup id=\"2Pet.3.18\" class=\"v61_3_18\">18</sup>But grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.
