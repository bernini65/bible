He went down to Joppa and found a ship going to Tarshish. So he paid the fare and went down into it, to go with them to Tarshish, away from the presence of the <span class=\"nd\">Lord</span>.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p\"><span class=\"v32_1_4\"><sup id=\"Jonah.1.4\" class=\"v32_1_4\">4</sup>But the <span class=\"nd\">Lord</span> hurled a great wind upon the sea, and there was a mighty tempest on the sea, so that the ship threatened to break up. </span><span class=\"v32_1_5\"><sup id=\"Jonah.1.5\" class=\"v32_1_5\">5</sup>Then the mariners were afraid, and each cried out to his god. And they hurled the cargo that was in the ship into the sea to lighten it for them. But Jonah had gone down into the inner part of the ship and had lain down and was fast asleep. </span><span class=\"v32_1_6\"><sup id=\"Jonah.1.6\" class=\"v32_1_6\">6</sup>So the captain came and said to him, \u201cWhat do you mean, you sleeper? Arise, call out to your god! Perhaps the god will give a thought to us, that we may not perish.\u201d</span></p>\n<h3 class=\"s1\">Jonah Is Thrown into the Sea</h3>\n<p class=\"p\"><span class=\"v32_1_7\"><sup id=\"Jonah.1.7\" class=\"v32_1_7\">7</sup>And they said to one another, \u201cCome, let us cast lots, that we may know on whose account this evil has come upon us.\u201d So they cast lots, and the lot fell on Jonah. </span><span class=\"v32_1_8\"><sup id=\"Jonah.1.8\" class=\"v32_1_8\">8</sup>Then they said to him, \u201cTell us on whose account this evil has come upon us. What is your occupation? And where do you come from? What is your country? And of what people are you?\u201d </span><span class=\"v32_1_9\"><sup id=\"Jonah.1.9\" class=\"v32_1_9\">9</sup>And he said to them, \u201cI am a Hebrew, and I fear the <span class=\"nd\">Lord</span>, the God of heaven, who made the sea and the dry land.\u201d </span><span class=\"v32_1_10\"><sup id=\"Jonah.1.10\" class=\"v32_1_10\">10</sup>Then the men were exceedingly afraid and said to him, \u201cWhat is this that you have done!\u201d For the men knew that he was fleeing from the presence of the <span class=\"nd\">Lord</span>, because he had told them.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p\"><span class=\"v32_1_11\"><sup id=\"Jonah.1.11\" class=\"v32_1_11\">11</sup>Then they said to him, \u201cWhat shall we do to you, that the sea may quiet down for us?\u201d For the sea grew more and more tempestuous. </span><span class=\"v32_1_12\"><sup id=\"Jonah.1.12\" class=\"v32_1_12\">12</sup>He said to them, \u201cPick me up and hurl me into the sea; then the sea will quiet down for you, for I know it is because of me that this great tempest has come upon you.\u201d </span><span class=\"v32_1_13\"><sup id=\"Jonah.1.13\" class=\"v32_1_13\">13</sup>Nevertheless, the men rowed hard to get back to dry land, but they could not, for the sea grew more and more tempestuous against them. </span><span class=\"v32_1_14\"><sup id=\"Jonah.1.14\" class=\"v32_1_14\">14</sup>Therefore they called out to the <span class=\"nd\">Lord</span>, \u201cO <span class=\"nd\">Lord</span>, let us not perish for this man\u2019s life, and lay not on us innocent blood, for you, O <span class=\"nd\">Lord</span>, have done as it pleased you.\u201d </span><span class=\"v32_1_15\"><sup id=\"Jonah.1.15\" class=\"v32_1_15\">15</sup>So they picked up Jonah and hurled him into the sea, and the sea ceased from its raging. </span><span class=\"v32_1_16\"><sup id=\"Jonah.1.16\" class=\"v32_1_16\">16</sup>Then the men feared the <span class=\"nd\">Lord</span> exceedingly, and they offered a sacrifice to the <span class=\"nd\">Lord</span> and made vows.</span></p>\n<h3 class=\"s1\">A Great Fish Swallows Jonah</h3>\n<p class=\"p\"><span class=\"v32_1_17\"><sup id=\"Jonah.1.17\" class=\"v32_1_17\">17</sup> And the <span class=\"nd\">Lord</span> appointed a great fish to swallow up Jonah.
