And I warned them on the day when they sold food. </span><span class=\"v16_13_16\"><sup id=\"Neh.13.16\" class=\"v16_13_16\">16</sup>Tyrians also, who lived in the city, brought in fish and all kinds of goods and sold them on the Sabbath to the people of Judah, in Jerusalem itself! </span><span class=\"v16_13_17\"><sup id=\"Neh.13.17\" class=\"v16_13_17\">17</sup>Then I confronted the nobles of Judah and said to them, \u201cWhat is this evil thing that you are doing, profaning the Sabbath day? </span><span class=\"v16_13_18\"><sup id=\"Neh.13.18\" class=\"v16_13_18\">18</sup>Did not your fathers act in this way, and did not our God bring all this disaster on us and on this city? Now you are bringing more wrath on Israel by profaning the Sabbath.\u201d</span></p>\n<p class=\"p\"><span class=\"v16_13_19\"><sup id=\"Neh.13.19\" class=\"v16_13_19\">19</sup>As soon as it began to grow dark at the gates of Jerusalem before the Sabbath, I commanded that the doors should be shut and gave orders that they should not be opened until after the Sabbath. And I stationed some of my servants at the gates, that no load might be brought in on the Sabbath day. </span><span class=\"v16_13_20\"><sup id=\"Neh.13.20\" class=\"v16_13_20\">20</sup>Then the merchants and sellers of all kinds of wares lodged outside Jerusalem once or twice. </span><span class=\"v16_13_21\"><sup id=\"Neh.13.21\" class=\"v16_13_21\">21</sup>But I warned them and said to them, \u201cWhy do you lodge outside the wall? If you do so again, I will lay hands on you.\u201d From that time on they did not come on the Sabbath. </span><span class=\"v16_13_22\"><sup id=\"Neh.13.22\" class=\"v16_13_22\">22</sup>Then I commanded the Levites that they should purify themselves and come and guard the gates, to keep the Sabbath day holy. Remember this also in my favor, O my God, and spare me according to the greatness of your steadfast love.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p\"><span class=\"v16_13_23\"><sup id=\"Neh.13.23\" class=\"v16_13_23\">23</sup>In those days also I saw the Jews who had married women of Ashdod, Ammon, and Moab. </span><span class=\"v16_13_24\"><sup id=\"Neh.13.24\" class=\"v16_13_24\">24</sup>And half of their children spoke the language of Ashdod, and they could not speak the language of Judah, but only the language of each people. </span><span class=\"v16_13_25\"><sup id=\"Neh.13.25\" class=\"v16_13_25\">25</sup>And I confronted them and cursed them and beat some of them and pulled out their hair. And I made them take an oath in the name of God, saying, \u201cYou shall not give your daughters to their sons, or take their daughters for your sons or for yourselves. </span><span class=\"v16_13_26\"><sup id=\"Neh.13.26\" class=\"v16_13_26\">26</sup>Did not Solomon king of Israel sin on account of such women? Among the many nations there was no king like him, and he was beloved by his God, and God made him king over all Israel. Nevertheless, foreign women made even him to sin. </span><span class=\"v16_13_27\"><sup id=\"Neh.13.27\" class=\"v16_13_27\">27</sup>Shall we then listen to you and do all this great evil and act treacherously against our God by marrying foreign women?\u201d</span></p>\n<p class=\"p\"><span class=\"v16_13_28\"><sup id=\"Neh.13.28\" class=\"v16_13_28\">28</sup>And one of the sons of Jehoiada, the son of Eliashib the high priest, was the son-in-law of Sanballat the Horonite. Therefore I chased him from me. </span><span class=\"v16_13_29\"><sup id=\"Neh.13.29\" class=\"v16_13_29\">29</sup>Remember them, O my God, because they have desecrated the priesthood and the covenant of the priesthood and the Levites.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p\"><span class=\"v16_13_30\"><sup id=\"Neh.13.30\" class=\"v16_13_30\">30</sup>Thus I cleansed them from everything foreign, and I established the duties of the priests and Levites, each in his work; </span><span class=\"v16_13_31\"><sup id=\"Neh.13.31\" class=\"v16_13_31\">31</sup>and I provided for the wood offering at appointed times, and for the firstfruits.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p\"><span class=\"v16_13_31\">Remember me, O my God, for good.</span></p>\n</div>\n",
