Likewise the husband does not have authority over his own body, but the wife does. </span><span class=\"v46_7_5\"><sup id=\"1Cor.7.5\" class=\"v46_7_5\">5</sup>Do not deprive one another, except perhaps by agreement for a limited time, that you may devote yourselves to prayer; but then come together again, so that Satan may not tempt you because of your lack of self-control.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p\"><span class=\"v46_7_6\"><sup id=\"1Cor.7.6\" class=\"v46_7_6\">6</sup>Now as a concession, not a command, I say this.</span><span class=\"v46_7_7\"><sup id=\"1Cor.7.7\" class=\"v46_7_7\">7</sup>I wish that all were as I myself am.

For the present form of this world is passing away.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p\"><span class=\"v46_7_32\"><sup id=\"1Cor.7.32\" class=\"v46_7_32\">32</sup>I want you to be free from anxieties. The unmarried man is anxious about the things of the Lord, how to please the Lord. </span><span class=\"v46_7_33\"><sup id=\"1Cor.7.33\" class=\"v46_7_33\">33</sup>But the married man is anxious about worldly things, how to please his wife, </span><span class=\"v46_7_34\"><sup id=\"1Cor.7.34\" class=\"v46_7_34\">34</sup>and his interests are divided. And the unmarried or betrothed woman is anxious about the things of the Lord, how to be holy in body and spirit. But the married woman is anxious about worldly things, how to please her husband. </span><span class=\"v46_7_35\"><sup id=\"1Cor.7.35\" class=\"v46_7_35\">35</sup>I say this for your own benefit, not to lay any restraint upon you, but to promote good order and to secure your undivided devotion to the Lord.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p\"><span class=\"v46_7_36\"><sup id=\"1Cor.7.36\" class=\"v46_7_36\">36</sup>If anyone thinks that he is not behaving properly toward his betrothed, if his passions are strong, and it has to be, let him do as he wishes: let them marry\u2014it is no sin. </span><span class=\"v46_7_37\"><sup id=\"1Cor.7.37\" class=\"v46_7_37\">37</sup>But whoever is firmly established in his heart, being under no necessity but having his desire under control, and has determined this in his heart, to keep her as his betrothed, he will do well. </span><span class=\"v46_7_38\"><sup id=\"1Cor.7.38\" class=\"v46_7_38\">38</sup>So then he who marries his betrothed does well, and he who refrains from marriage will do even better.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p\"><span class=\"v46_7_39\"><sup id=\"1Cor.7.39\" class=\"v46_7_39\">39</sup>A wife is bound to her husband as long as he lives.

I hope to spend some time with you, if the Lord permits. </span><span class=\"v46_16_8\"><sup id=\"1Cor.16.8\" class=\"v46_16_8\">8</sup>But I will stay in Ephesus until Pentecost, </span><span class=\"v46_16_9\"><sup id=\"1Cor.16.9\" class=\"v46_16_9\">9</sup>for a wide door for effective work has opened to me, and there are many adversaries.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p\"><span class=\"v46_16_10\"><sup id=\"1Cor.16.10\" class=\"v46_16_10\">10</sup>When Timothy comes, see that you put him at ease among you, for he is doing the work of the Lord, as I am. </span><span class=\"v46_16_11\"><sup id=\"1Cor.16.11\" class=\"v46_16_11\">11</sup>So let no one despise him. Help him on his way in peace, that he may return to me, for I am expecting him with the brothers.</span></p>\n<h3 class=\"s1\">Final Instructions</h3>\n<p class=\"p\"><span class=\"v46_16_12\"><sup id=\"1Cor.16.12\" class=\"v46_16_12\">12</sup>Now concerning our brother Apollos, I strongly urged him to visit you with the other brothers, but it was not at all his will to come now. He will come when he has opportunity.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p\"><span class=\"v46_16_13\"><sup id=\"1Cor.16.13\" class=\"v46_16_13\">13</sup>Be watchful, stand firm in the faith, act like men, be strong. </span><span class=\"v46_16_14\"><sup id=\"1Cor.16.14\" class=\"v46_16_14\">14</sup>Let all that you do be done in love.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p\"><span class=\"v46_16_15\"><sup id=\"1Cor.16.15\" class=\"v46_16_15\">15</sup>Now I urge you, brothers\u2014you know that the household of Stephanas were the first converts in Achaia, and that they have devoted themselves to the service of the saints\u2014 </span><span class=\"v46_16_16\"><sup id=\"1Cor.16.16\" class=\"v46_16_16\">16</sup>be subject to such as these, and to every fellow worker and laborer. </span><span class=\"v46_16_17\"><sup id=\"1Cor.16.17\" class=\"v46_16_17\">17</sup>I rejoice at the coming of Stephanas and Fortunatus and Achaicus, because they have made up for your absence, </span><span class=\"v46_16_18\"><sup id=\"1Cor.16.18\" class=\"v46_16_18\">18</sup>for they refreshed my spirit as well as yours. Give recognition to such people.</span></p>\n<h3 class=\"s1\">Greetings</h3>\n<p class=\"p\"><span class=\"v46_16_19\"><sup id=\"1Cor.16.19\" class=\"v46_16_19\">19</sup>The churches of Asia send you greetings. Aquila and Prisca, together with the church in their house, send you hearty greetings in the Lord. </span><span class=\"v46_16_20\"><sup id=\"1Cor.16.20\" class=\"v46_16_20\">20</sup>All the brothers send you greetings.
