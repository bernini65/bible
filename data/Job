The <span class=\"nd\">Lord</span> gave, and the <span class=\"nd\">Lord</span> has taken away; blessed be the name of the <span class=\"nd\">Lord</span>.\u201d</span></p>\n<p class=\"p\"><span class=\"v18_1_22\"><sup id=\"Job.1.22\" class=\"v18_1_22\">22</sup>In all this Job did not sin or charge God with wrong.</span></p>\n</div>\n",

Shall we receive good from God, and shall we not receive evil?\u201d In all this Job did not sin with his lips.</span></p>\n<h3 class=\"s1\">Job\u2019s Three Friends</h3>\n<p class=\"p\"><span class=\"v18_2_11\"><sup id=\"Job.2.11\" class=\"v18_2_11\">11</sup>Now when Job\u2019s three friends heard of all this evil that had come upon him, they came each from his own place, Eliphaz the Temanite, Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite. They made an appointment together to come to show him sympathy and comfort him. </span><span class=\"v18_2_12\"><sup id=\"Job.2.12\" class=\"v18_2_12\">12</sup>And when they saw him from a distance, they did not recognize him. And they raised their voices and wept, and they tore their robes and sprinkled dust on their heads toward heaven. </span><span class=\"v18_2_13\"><sup id=\"Job.2.13\" class=\"v18_2_13\">13</sup>And they sat with him on the ground seven days and seven nights, and no one spoke a word to him, for they saw that his suffering was very great.</span></p>\n</div>\n",

And my servant Job shall pray for you, for I will accept his prayer not to deal with you according to your folly. For you have not spoken of me what is right, as my servant Job has.\u201d </span><span class=\"v18_42_9\"><sup id=\"Job.42.9\" class=\"v18_42_9\">9</sup>So Eliphaz the Temanite and Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the Naamathite went and did what the <span class=\"nd\">Lord</span> had told them, and the <span class=\"nd\">Lord</span> accepted Job\u2019s prayer.</span></p>\n<h3 class=\"s1\">The <span class=\"nd\">Lord</span> Restores Job\u2019s Fortunes</h3>\n<p class=\"p\"><span class=\"v18_42_10\"><sup id=\"Job.42.10\" class=\"v18_42_10\">10</sup>And the <span class=\"nd\">Lord</span>restored the fortunes of Job, when he had prayed for his friends. And the <span class=\"nd\">Lord</span> gave Job twice as much as he had before. </span><span class=\"v18_42_11\"><sup id=\"Job.42.11\" class=\"v18_42_11\">11</sup>Then came to him all his brothers and sisters and all who had known him before, and ate bread with him in his house. And they showed him sympathy and comforted him for all the evil that the <span class=\"nd\">Lord</span> had brought upon him. And each of them gave him a piece of money and a ring of gold.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p\"><span class=\"v18_42_12\"><sup id=\"Job.42.12\" class=\"v18_42_12\">12</sup>And the <span class=\"nd\">Lord</span> blessed the latter days of Job more than his beginning. And he had 14,000 sheep, 6,000 camels, 1,000 yoke of oxen, and 1,000 female donkeys. </span><span class=\"v18_42_13\"><sup id=\"Job.42.13\" class=\"v18_42_13\">13</sup>He had also seven sons and three daughters. </span><span class=\"v18_42_14\"><sup id=\"Job.42.14\" class=\"v18_42_14\">14</sup>And he called the name of the first daughter Jemimah, and the name of the second Keziah, and the name of the third Keren-happuch. </span><span class=\"v18_42_15\"><sup id=\"Job.42.15\" class=\"v18_42_15\">15</sup>And in all the land there were no women so beautiful as Job\u2019s daughters. And their father gave them an inheritance among their brothers. </span><span class=\"v18_42_16\"><sup id=\"Job.42.16\" class=\"v18_42_16\">16</sup>And after this Job lived 140 years, and saw his sons, and his sons\u2019 sons, four generations. </span><span class=\"v18_42_17\"><sup id=\"Job.42.17\" class=\"v18_42_17\">17</sup>And Job died, an old man, and full of days.</span></p>\n</div>\n",
